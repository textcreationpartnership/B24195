            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is now somewhat above half an year since the following Papers were finished; and perhaps they may never come abroad, but at the discretion of our Adversaries, though they have now, well nigh gone through the Press: For, why may we not suspect, that they will be seized as well as the learned <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s answer was t'other day, tho' Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> had dar'd him to make a Reply, and promised him the liberty of the Press, in an unhandsome Letter which he sent him about <hi>August</hi> last, and it was the only stroke in it that savour'd of decency and good manners: I am apt to think that so great rudeness has not been offer'd to so learned a Man before: and if the Doctor does not make amends to his Reputation, by finding some ways that the Sheets may be restor'd, or by publickly declaring that it is not in his power to have it done, he must, his best friends being judges, leave it in a very low and forlorn condition. But tho' our <hi>Vindicator</hi> had such ill success, providence so far favour'd us, that when we were putting
<pb facs="tcp:200314:3"/> our Sheets into the Printer's hands, there comes out a Book, which is, entituled, <hi>The Bishop of</hi> Sarum<hi>'s Vindication: or, Reflections upon a Pamphlet, entituled, Some Discourses upon Doctor</hi> Burnet <hi>and Doctor</hi> Tillotson, <hi>occasion'd by the late Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sermon of the former upon the latter, by the Right Reverend Father in God, <hi>Gilbert</hi> Lord Bishop of</hi> Sarum.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 52.</note>In this Book he tells us, <hi>that Dr.</hi> Hody <hi>has fully ended the Argument he had begun from the Practise of the Church, and that in so convincing a manner, that matters of fact seem'd not to be capable of a clearer proof; and though we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended other reasons, and make an excuse for not answering him, the true reason why the Book</hi> [of the Case of the Sees vacant] <hi>is not answer'd, is, because it cannot be answer'd; men may wrangle eternally in Points of Speculation, but matters of fact are severe things, and do not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of that sophistry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this he adds, <hi>that the Practice of the Church is evidently made out to have been this; that since the Church cannot be kept in order with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Governors, when Princes turn out Bishops, tho' upon groundless and untrue suggestions, but without any design to corrupt and alter the Faith, in such a case, the Church is rather to bear a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular injury then to break with the Prince, to forfeit his protection, or to venture on his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
<pb facs="tcp:200314:3"/> even in protecting an innocent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Bishop. Sacred Orders are indeed deriv'd according to the Rules of the Gospel: but the allotment of this or that Bishop, to this or that See, are things of a mixed nature, in which the Civil as well as the Ecclesiastical authority have their share; both are under the Rules of Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Prudence: and the Protection of the Magistrate is of that consequence to the whole, and to the advance of Religion it self, as well as to the quiet and safety of all the Members of that Body, that it is certainly better to bear, even with a particular injustice, then, by opposing it, to venture on a Concussion of the whole Frame.</hi> He goes on, and makes us two challenges; the first is in these words;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We challenge them to shew us any one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 146, 147.</note>
               <hi>where after a Revolution of the State hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that was generally receiv'd and settled, the Bishops and Pastors of the Church refused to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the present Civil Government, and to act in their station under it; and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, where any Revolution happened, which rescued and settled the true Religion, that was not receiv'd with general joy and gratitude, even though the methods of it, and steps of it, were liable to just and great exceptions: we are sure they cannot shew any instance that looks like a precedent to their Proceedings; but that the
<pb facs="tcp:200314:4"/> whole course of History is one continued Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in our favour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is in these words; <hi>we challenge them to shew us where ever a Schism was formed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lay Deprivation of a Bishop, even when the grounds that it proceeded on were visibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, if the Faith of the Church was not pretended to be concern'd in the matter; more particularly we challenge them to shew us an instance, where the Bishop or Clergy of a Church adher'd to a Metropolitan or a Bishop, so turn'd out, or made a Schism upon his account, when he did not by any publick act or instrument assert his own Right, and challenge the Obedience of those who were subordinate to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 1, 8.</note>He says farther: <hi>That our leaving the general Argument from the constant uninterrupted Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church, and betaking our selves to the methods of slander and defamation, is such an evident vindication of a bad cause, and of a worse managery, that it is not possible but that the generality of indifferent Men will soon discern how weak our Reasons, and strong our Passions are: that we have in all our Writings built too much upon the Practice of the Church, to be able with any shame to reject this Argument, and to say, that we ought to be governed by Rules and not by Examples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which bold challenges, and most false groundless as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions,
<pb facs="tcp:200314:4"/> there are many things unskillfully and untheologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally laid down and expressed, and call for a castigation: insomuch, that if this <hi>Vindicator</hi> had not, t'other day, autoritatively demanded a Recantation from Mr. <hi>Altham</hi> upon his Licensing the learned Mr. <hi>Hill</hi>'s Book, which he wrote against him on Just Principles, and with sound Reasonings, this his performance is alone a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing indication that he writes and acts not with the skill of a Divine, but upon raw and indigested Thoughts: or, rather, in the strength of his Peerage, and under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a <hi>Writ</hi> called <hi>Scandalum Magnatum.</hi> I'll divert my self and my Reader a little, in taking notice of two or three of his rash productions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> He tells us, that <hi>the Church cannot be kept in order without Governors,</hi> i. e. without the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Power. Pray, how then was she governed, and all things done decently and in order by her own Charter and Officers, in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, and from thence to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Great, during which space, the Empire was Heathen, and its Secular Arm gave her little or no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, but with <hi>Gallio,</hi> its Deputy in the <hi>Acts,</hi> cared for none of these things? Can we think that our Saviour founded and erected a Corporation with its own Officers and their Subordinates, through the merits and vertue of his Cross, to subsist under it in the time of Persecution, and did not furnish it with just means and abilities to preserve it self, when the Secular Power frown'd, even rag'd, upon it, whether it was then Christian or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:200314:5"/>
               <hi>2.</hi> What does he mean when he says, that if the Prince offers violence to the Bishop, and <hi>turns him out,</hi> in such a case the Church is to submit <hi>rather then to break with the Prince, and forfeit his</hi> Protection? The Church of God stands and acts by vertue of her Charter from Christ: She is thankfull to the Prince for the worldly immunities and protections with which he vests her; but if she be depriv'd of these, either in part, or in the whole, her Charter remains the same, and retains its original force and obligation; and she subsists neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, by the promise and assistance of her Saviour, as she did before any secular donation was bestow'd upon her: her Revenues may not be so large upon it, but her constitution and essential rights, her, even vigor, are not lessened: she neither <hi>breaks</hi> with the Prince by departing from him, much less by opposing him, nor <hi>forfeits,</hi> tho' she loses those favours which he had bestowed upon her; but still acts in the same Subordination as to Christ her head in Spirituals, and to the Prince her head in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals: neither did she receive one secular donation, but on condition that her Corporation, and the Liberties with which Christ vested it, should receive no abatement, much less a plenary and final abrogation. And it may be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther observed, that as this <hi>Vindicator</hi> in a few lines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, makes the Churches subsistence, even ber <hi>frame</hi> and being, to depend on the Princes favour, the <hi>Concussion</hi> of which he mightily fears, and wou'd have every body else do so, upon his displeasure, so he again seems, in the same Paragraph, to vest the Church with an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
<pb facs="tcp:200314:5"/> right of Independency and Non-subordination to him, and to stand upon and execute it, if it be for her advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. For, what else can he mean, when, having af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd the <hi>Magistrates Prorection of the Bishops</hi> to be necessary, he yet owns the Church to have a right to <hi>protect</hi> an injured innocent Bishop, and to <hi>allot a Bishop to this or that See,</hi> as well as the Prince, at her own <hi>discretion and prudence?</hi> And he that will not take this for a self-contradiction, must first make it to appear that these two propositions are competible, <hi>the Church is unable to protect her self, and to subsist without the Magistrate: the Church hath a Power to protect her self, and to subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Magistrate.</hi> And, which is worst of all, he allows these Rights, which he, with so much difficulty, asserts to be in the Church, to be sacrificed to the Princes <hi>displeasure:</hi> and the <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>injur'd Bishop</hi> is no more <hi>to be protected,</hi> but to be given up, in the time of persecution.</p>

               <hi>3.</hi> He farther shews his loose and indigested Thoughts, when he says; that, <hi>the allotment of a Bishop to this or that See is of a mixed nature, in which the Civil, as well as the Ecclesiastical Authority have their share; both are under discretion and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> If by <hi>allotment</hi> he means <hi>nomination,</hi> or (which was the same in the Ancient Church) <hi>Election,</hi> his distribution is imperfect; for, the Prince, and Bishop, and People had their share in it, during some time of the Ancient Church, in which the Prince was Christian, and sometimes one of them, sometimes the other, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="tcp:200314:6"/> all of them joyntly, made this <hi>allotment:</hi> and since he is (at least pretends to be) so strenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a retreiver of the Practice of the Ancient Church, and wou'd to be apprehended to make it his rule, he may not be conceived to take it in this sense, because he seems to allow the People no <hi>share</hi> in it: I will add, (which in the upcast will mostly prevail with him) since the Laws of our Land have limited the nomination of a Bishop <hi>to this or that See</hi> to the Prince, and do not allow the Bishop or People to have any thing to do with it. Again, if by <hi>Allotment</hi> he means <hi>Election,</hi> as distinct from <hi>nomination,</hi> as our latter Ecclesiasticks use it; thus the same Muncipal Law of our Land places it in the Church and People, but I do not find that the Princes has meddled with it, or pretended to a share in it. Or, if by <hi>Allotment</hi> he means, the actual vesting of a Bishop with his Spiritual Right <hi>in this or that district,</hi> or the enthroning him upon his <hi>Nomination</hi> and <hi>Election,</hi> the Church Officers only perform this, and the Practice, not only of our own Church, but of the whole Church of God justifies them in it; neither the Prince or People have been concern'd in it, either by the Laws of our Land, or of the Church. This <hi>Vindicator</hi> therefore ought to have been more carefull in his expression, since, let him take <hi>Allotment,</hi> in which of the forementioned Senses he thinks fit, he is short, or quite mistaken. But if he confines it to <hi>Nomination,</hi> as opposed to <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Enthroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation,</hi> he evidently brings himself into a <hi>Premunire;</hi> because he diminishes from the King's Prerogative, making
<pb facs="tcp:200314:6"/> it a <hi>mixed action,</hi> and asserting the Ecclesiastical Authority to have a share with him in the <hi>Nomination</hi> of a Bishop, as it shall be directed by the <hi>Rules of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and Prudence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I forbear to insist any longer here, least I should outrun the bounds which I have design'd for this <hi>Preface;</hi> neither need I take any advantage from these and the like out-works, since the following <hi>Collections,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Practice of the Church and Empire in the Reigns of <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Constantius,</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> in part, do abundantly shew in <hi>so convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a manner, that matters of fact seem not to be capable of a clearer proof,</hi> that this <hi>Vindicators</hi> main Cause is founded on the Sand, and obtruded on Mankind without any precedent in Church History, so far as those reigns do reach, or foundation in things: and that the Empire, then disown'd and remov'd those Rights, in placing a Bishop in his Spiritual Charge within his district, which he pretends it had; and the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated upon it, when <hi>Constantius</hi> once attempted it. So that <hi>the whole course of History,</hi> within the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned interval of time, <hi>is one continued Precedent,</hi> not in his but in our <hi>favour,</hi> and it is thence manifest, that as we have not <hi>left the general Argument from the constant uninterrupted Practice of the Church,</hi> (in the true Ecclesiastical Sense, which concludes the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be constant and uninterrupted, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for some time, perhaps, by but a few Catholick hands, when a more numerous company of Hereticks and
<pb facs="tcp:200314:7"/> Schismaticks trash and interlope it) as this <hi>Vindicator</hi> slanders and defames us; much less that <hi>we betake our selves to the methods of slander and defamation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of it,</hi> so it is no less plain that we had no need to do it. The meek, and pious, and most learned <hi>Vindicator of the deprived Sees,</hi> yet unanswer'd, is, alone, a just confutation of it. But the judicious Reader will find the Truths which I shall set down by and by, to be as plain and legible in the following <hi>Collections,</hi> as the Sun is visible at noon, in a clear day: each of which are full in the Teeth of the Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi>'s <hi>Vindicator,</hi> and in contradiction to that which he hath, as above recited out of his own <hi>Vindication,</hi> with so much assurance, and contempt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on us, asserted. And though he cannot, perhaps, or will not, yet indifferent Readers will see, that there might be other reasons why we have not answer'd Doctor <hi>Hody,</hi> so soon as he thinks we ought to have done, besides those which he gives, who makes them our ignorance and inability, and <hi>because he cannot be answer'd,</hi> since he will find, that we had just grounds to contemn him: he needed not, indeed, have been answer'd now, were it not to rectifie and set in their true light those truths and matters of fact, which he hath ignorantly and injudiciously involv'd and obscur'd, or passed over, or, which is worse, wilfully conceal'd. The truths are these that follow; most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently prov'd to be such, upon the Principles, and from the Practice of the Church, in the Reigns of the two first Christian Emperors: the same, in part, being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually manifested from the succeeding Reigns of <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Theodosius.</hi> As.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:200314:7"/>
            <p>That if the Prince should turn out Bishops, and pretend to discharge their People of their Obedience to them, upon what suggestions soever, whether they be true or false, but maintain the Faith unalter'd and unspotted, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of that Age (and its Practice was accordingly, upon each occasion) directed the Church to adhere to the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and innocent Bishops so deprived, contrary to her Laws, and by an incompetent Power, and to chuse rather to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Prince's displeasure, and to lose his Protection, and to depend upon her Charter given her by Christ, for her preservation, then to recognize and submit to such a Deprivation.</p>
            <p>That as not Sacred Orders, so neither was the Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Bishop in his Spiritual Right and Charge <hi>in this or that See,</hi> then, lookt upon to be a thing of a <hi>mixed nature,</hi> in which <hi>the Civil as well as the Ecclesiastical Authority have their share,</hi> but, as the former, so the latter was to be performed by the Ecclesiastical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity only.</p>
            <p>That the Empire it self then <hi>disown'd</hi> all right, by which it might be enabled to derive a Bishop's Spiritual Charge on him, or to take it from him, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elease his People of their Obedience to him: And, not only so, but, the Empire accounted such an attempt to be profane, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, unscriptural, and an usurpation; and declar'd the Right of doing it to belong to the Bishop only.</p>
            <p>That there was no Revolution in the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during this interval of Time, and the Query is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, what was then the Churches Practice under a
<pb facs="tcp:200314:8"/> Revolution? But since the then Bishops refused to own and submit to the Emperor's Power in placing and displacing Bishops, though the Emperor was settled there by the Law of the Empire, and not upon a forcible removal of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor, or a Revolution; since these Bishops then declar'd their unquestionably lawful Governor a Persecutor, the worst of Persecutors; Antichrist and Sacrilegious, upon his doing such a thing; we may safely believe that they would not have recogniz'd and submitted to the same Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session or Deprivation, if it had been made by a Governor placed over them upon a Revolution, when his Title was questionable, but that they wou'd have retain'd those ejected Bishops in the Colledge, and made good their stations, tho' themselves were deprived by him for it, and he had placed a <hi>Second</hi> upon them. The Bishops of the Church are to keep their stations, and, so far as their personal liberty ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them, to discharge their Functions under the present Government, be it just or unjust. Christ's Charter requires and enables them to do it: no question can be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. But the Query is, if the present Government, be it what it will, (it is all one, in this regard, whether it be just or unjust) imposes on them unlawful terms, and, on their non-compliance with these terms disenables them to discharge their Functions, in publick or altogether; whether they are not bound to acquiesce under that disability, rather then take it off, and recover their liberty, by complying with those unlawful terms? But, especially, when the Charter of Christ it self, and that Unity which is essential to it, are in danger to be deliver'd into the hands of the Civil Power, and to be violated by it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:200314:8"/>
            <p>That the Catholick Bishops and Pastors of the Church always separated (the <hi>Vindicator</hi> of the Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi> may, in his loose and unthinking way of speaking, when he states cases, call it making a Schism) I say, they always separated from those Bishops that were brought into their Colledge upon a Deprivation, though the Empire had an hand in it, and, at the least, confirm'd it: and the Catholick Presbyters and Believers did so likewise, when the same Bishops were brought into their respective Districts upon the same voidance, whether the Faith of the Church was pretended by them to be concern'd in it, or not: and where the Faith was own'd to be really concern'd, the Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical intrust of a Bishop (which was thought to be made when a Lay Hand, though it was a Royal Hand, did it) was believ'd as just a ground for their separation, and to contract as deep a guilt, if he was receiv'd and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, as the heretical imposing a false Article of Faith, if it was embraced and subscrib'd to.</p>
            <p>That the then Bishops adher'd to a Metropolitan, or another Bishop, as continuing true Members of their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or Episcopal Fraternity, and the Clergy and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers closed with and adher'd to them, as their lawful heads, in their respective Districts, when they were removed from them by a Lay Power that was <hi>irresistible;</hi> and, not only so, but, when they were banish'd into a remote Land; and, so far as we find in any Church Law which oblig'd them to it, or matter of fact to president them in it, this they did, though these their Bishops had not (sometimes their hard circumstances might be such that they could not)
<pb facs="tcp:200314:9"/>
               <hi>asserted their own Rights upon their leaving of them:</hi> nor did afterwards <hi>challenge the Obedience of those that were Subordinate to them,</hi> i. e. such the Presbyters and Believers adhering to them, by <hi>any publick Episcopal act, or instrument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That though the then Catholick Clergy and Believers built the whole frame of their Proceedings in these Cases, as upon the Principles, so, upon the Practice and Authority of the Church, they were not ashamed to say, under some Emergencies, when Persecution was high, and Professors were thin, and to insist upon it, that they were to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by <hi>Rules and not by Examples:</hi> and that the rule, not the numerousness of those who shrank from it in the time of distress, was their guid: and they compar'd their case with those of <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons Den, and the three Children in the fiery Furnace, in respect of their fewness in number. And though this <hi>Vindicator</hi> wou'd have done it, none in those days, or since, except some few of his complexion, have thought it to be a <hi>vindication of a bad cause, and of a worse managery,</hi> nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <hi>their reasons to be weak,</hi> or <hi>their passions to be strong</hi> by reason of it. Nor will, even, this <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator,</hi> when he is out of a Party, or any body else, that is unprejudiced, say, that examples, though they be never so numerous, and otherwise great, have any force or obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but (to speak in his own words) <hi>when a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is once laid, and a Cause is provided to be just in it self:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 112.</note>
               <hi>then the steps of providence that watch over it, will be observ'd by all that are not atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and irreligious.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:200314:9"/>
            <p>Now, all this, with a great deal more to the like effect, by which Doctor <hi>Hody</hi>'s whole Fabrick is totally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, being prov'd at large, as in the following <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> upon a sure foundation of Principles, and from as good Authority, as to matters of fact, as any hath been in Christendom, since the Apostolical Writings were penned; I hope we shall be no more upbraided (tho' we may still be contemned) for not answering the Doctor's Book of <hi>The Vindication of the Sees vacant,</hi> as that Book which <hi>could not be answer'd.</hi> Neither do I know why these Sheets may not also go for an answer to the <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s mighty <hi>challenge,</hi> in which, with a Spirit too near a kin to that of <hi>Goliah</hi> of <hi>Gath,</hi> and in the same <hi>Thrasoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> way that <hi>uncircumcised Philistine</hi> did, he bids de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to the Armies of the living God, through the sides of the little <hi>Remnant</hi> of the present distressed Church of <hi>England,</hi> and I expect no handsomer dealings from him hereafter, nor any other return at present then what he hath generally made, for some years past, to other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which gall'd him, but he durst not pretend to answer them.

               </note> And, perhaps, I may be called a <hi>Knight of the Post,</hi> as one is; because I have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd some Truths which this <hi>Vindicator</hi> and his friend Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> were ignorant of, and are as unable to bear as to disprove. I had like to have forgotten, that <hi>a long Title</hi> is another of his Arguments, by which he enervates, in his enervating way, the Learned, Judicious, and most Catholick Tract, entituled, <hi>The Charge of the Socinianism against Doctor</hi> Tillotson<hi>'s consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</hi> &amp;c. to which as I am equally liable; so I expect my share of it: but a Brother of his has since convinc'd him that that Book has something in it, and forced a kind of ibid supra recantation from him for his heady, rash contempt which he has cast upon it: though his friends <hi>Vindication</hi> leaves their <hi>Primate</hi> in the dirt, and does a little more than wash the <hi>Aethiopian Skin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, are not these trivial thread-bare Phrases and Expressions fine Arguments to use against several Treatises concerning Schism, and other weighty Subjects, wrote with
<pb facs="tcp:200314:10"/> as much acuteness, reading, solid judgment, and weight of argument as any controversie has been stated and argued since the Apostles days; the greatest part of which have not yet been pretended to have been answer'd any other way? Which have been wrote, also, with as much temper and candor as any of the ancients Tracts have been: For the, even, Primitive Champions of our Faith and Discipline have still used a great deal of warmth, and never waved any just opportunity of exposing and aggravating the sleights and tergiversations, even, immoralities, of their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, in their own defences and justifications. Though one would think, since this <hi>Vindicator</hi> has had, very late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, one of his Books burn'd by the common Hangman, by the Order of the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> and another just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chastised by the learned Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> it might have coold him a little, and learnt him some tenderness for those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who write, possibly, with a good meaning, but may not perform, in every little particular, so dexterously and advantageously as some others do. It seems, even, his lawn sleeves have not alter'd him, unless for the worse, and he has not attain'd, at least in appearance, more wit or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in his representations of things and persons, since he put them on. But let him go on in his way for me; as I have no reason to regard his railery, neither do I fear his strength of argument. And, surely, having lost all I have to lose, I shall not be frighted into a recantation, as Mr. <hi>Altham</hi> was. Besides, I am well ussur'd that the Authorities which I have produced, and the Temper which I have used in my stile and way of arguing are such, that the
<pb facs="tcp:200314:11"/> ingenuous Reader will not take offence, though he does dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the subject matter: and if his great acuteness and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning judgment should discover some mistakes and failures in the Narrative and Argument, of which I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be wholly free, and I will thank him if he gives me notice of them: nor can I think that any one will receive the whole with the <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s Spirit, except himself, and some few more, if there should be any such, who make it their own concern, that Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> is here prov'd to be an ill Historian, and a weak and fallacious reasoner.</p>
            <p>I desire it may be consider'd, that this whole perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance is Historical, as the Title speaks it: and if the Doctrines and Practices, of which I give an account, be distastful to the Reader, I hope be will be so candid and just as to pass me by, and lay them at the doors of those who delivered and practiced them: who are no other then the most eminent Catholick Bishops, Confessors and Champions for the Cause of Christ in the Reigns of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great and <hi>Constantius</hi> his Son, with some others a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle later in time, but not less eminent, who joyfully suffered the loss of their goods, and sustain'd the banishment of their Persons into remote Countries, and were, moreover, ready to die in the attestation and defence of them, being Martyrs, though their blood was not pour'd out, (for <hi>Constantius</hi> made no Sanguinary Laws) in the sense of the ancient Church. And I doubt not but that they are such in the acceptance of Christ; nor in the least question but that they have, at this instant, a first place in Heaven, and enjoy a nearer attendance on God there, agreeably to <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s

                     <item>It is the duty of a Christian Bishop to be very careful that he does not deliver up the rights of the Church, deposited in his hands, contrary to the end of their commitment to him, though an <hi>irresistible Power,</hi> even the Emperor with his drawn sword, should demand them of him. Nothing but Church Mens unfaithfulness can betray the Churches right into forrein hands.

                  <p>I Have taken some pains, in another Tract, and consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the most eminent Authorities and Instances in the three first Centuries of the Church; and there found that <hi>the secular Power</hi> is, all along, accounted to have no right in disposing of the Bishops, as to their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, in their respective Districts and Governments; and that all <hi>Lay-deprivations,</hi> and Successors, or Seconds, pursuant to them, are reputed to be <hi>uncanonical and unlawful,</hi> and were rejected, as such, and no ways to be complyed with by the then Bishops and Subjects of the Church; if any such thing should be attempted, as it was not within that period of time: Such power being seated by the <hi>Father</hi> only in the <hi>Son,</hi> and thence derived, by the <hi>Son's</hi> Appointment, to the Apostles and Bishops their Successors, and confined to them until the Government it self shall have an end, and <hi>be delivered up to the Father.</hi>

                  <p>Leaving therefore this lucky Atchievement of the <hi>Doctor's,</hi> so much for the honour and advantage of <hi>Christ and his Church,</hi> to that more full and particular account of it, which the World may have in due time, if <hi>God</hi> gives me Life and Opportunity; I continued my Labour, and enquired into the sense and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church and State when the Empire became <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> from <hi>Constantine the Great</hi> downwards throughout the best Ages: and I here found also, that not only the Bishops and Doctors, but even the Emperors themselves, within this Interval, did conclude, that the secular, personal, removal of a Bishop from his District, as by Banishment, Imprisonment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby he became wholly uncapable, or less able for a time, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his Pastoral Function, did not directly, and by it's own force make way for a <hi>Second,</hi> or <hi>Sucessor;</hi> and that no other but Church Hands could effectually depose him, and acquit his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Duty to him; nor upon a just deposition, constitute a <hi>Successor,</hi> and create in him a true Ecclesiastical, I may say, Gospel Right over the Believers, within that District which is truly vacated, in the same measure the Predecessor had it, being justly such ere he was deposed. The Empire, in becoming Christian, had many advantages, as well as the Church; but it

As, <hi>that the</hi> Heathen <hi>Emperors were ignorant of this Prerogative, or thought it less considerable, or not at all to be regarded, as they did the Christians themselves, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: What cared they for a</hi> Fairy Government, <hi>as</hi> Mr. Hobbs <hi>has since call'd it, and they then thought it to be? And since the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire did not concern it self with it, who else but the Bishops should ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it, as their Discretion directed them?</hi> But I do here ask these Men, who thus seem to argue, had <hi>Constantine, Constantius, Jovian, Valentinian, Gratian,</hi> the two <hi>Theodosius's, Honorius,</hi> with other eminent Emperors, the same opinion of it's Regiment in general, or it's Governours, and their Successors in particular? or can they be supposed to have been regardless of their Church Prerogatives? Or to have suffered the Bishops to assume them? Besides, the Church (as the judicious <hi>Cassander,</hi>

And farther if any Emperour, or otherwayes illegal power has attempted and effected such a thing; and so set up, or depriv'd a Bishop; a competent number of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or Episcopal fraternity, and of under Officers and Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that were truly conscientious and Christian, have alwayes remonstrated, upon Gospel Principles, and adhered notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the one, and rejected the other.</p>

                  <p>It is ten to one but that Dr. <hi>Hody</hi> will come in here also with his wonderful Argument, and prove, that tho' these Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans cannot be said to have actually disown'd an Orthodox Bishop, put upon them by the Empire, because then it did not think fit to put one upon them; yet they would not have disown'd such a Bishop, if the Empire had thought fit to impose him.

                  <p>It will be found apparently manifest from <hi>Eustathius</hi>'s case, that the removal of a Bishop, and taking him from his personal care and inspection of his people, by banishment, or any other means, does neither cut off their Relation and <hi>Duty</hi> to him, nor his Relation, nor right to them; but they notwithstanding remain his Flock, and he their Bishop.

As for those that say there were two <hi>Eustathius's,</hi> the one of <hi>Sebastia,</hi> and the other of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and that he of <hi>Antioch</hi> was not the Legantine Bishop from the <hi>East,</hi> and did not consecrate <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but he of <hi>Sebastia</hi> did both: I cannot be any ways affected with it, as to our present Argument; (tho' upon a thorough enquiry they may be found to be in a mistake) since those against whom I advance it, do contend but for one, which is he of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and that it was he who perform'd those Offices. Besides, if <hi>Eustathius</hi> had been actually and truly depos'd, and the Orthodox had deem'd him to be, and remain so, how came it to pass that they did not Elect another in his room, but let the See continue vacant till <hi>Meletius</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron'd, which was, at least, thirty years after, during some part of which time it was fill'd with <hi>Arian</hi> Bishops, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly such, and from the beginning with those whom the <hi>Arian</hi> contagion had deeply infected, but it appear'd not so publickly as afterwards? as we read in <hi>Theodorit</hi>

This is contrary to the Practice of the Church in those times, which still continu'd a Succession in opposition to the <hi>Arians:</hi> And since she did not do it here, we are to believe it was because she knew the See to be fill'd by <hi>Eustathius,</hi> till <hi>Meletius</hi> was made Bishop there: And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently did not look upon <hi>Eustathius</hi> Abdication to be made on true Church grounds and to be effectual.</p>
                  <p>If it be replied, how came it then to pass that <hi>Constantine</hi> did own and abet <hi>Eustathius</hi>'s Abdication with his secular Arm, and banish'd his person, (it may be believed) upon his non

                  <p n="4">4ly. But to come closer to the Doctors own Arguings: What he contends for, in these following words, may in part be granted him: <hi>Viz.</hi>
                     <q>That <hi>Eustathius</hi> and the Orthodox Party,<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 188.</note> did not own and receive the <hi>Second,</hi> or <hi>Successors,</hi> which were placed in the <hi>Antiochian</hi> See, upon his Banishment, until <hi>Meletius</hi> was Enthron'd who was Orthodox; Because before his Admission, such <hi>Seconds</hi> were accounted <hi>Arians:</hi> But then <hi>Eustathius</hi> gave over, and never concern'd himself any more as Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> being secur'd of an Orthodox <hi>Successor.</hi>
                     </q> But though we do grant that this was one reason, and at that time, their only reason, which they produced: yet might they not have separated, as they then did, and made their Conventions under other Bishops, whom they believed to be legal, and given some other account of it, which was justifiable, upon those terms which the Church stands engag'd to accept? What if that Succession that was placed upon <hi>Eustathius</hi> was not <hi>Arian?</hi> And some<note n="‖" place="margin">Baron an. <hi>340.</hi>
                     </note> contend it was not: Of which I am hereafter to give an account:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:200314:28"/> (Supposing what the Doctor and we at present allow, <hi>Viz.</hi> That <hi>Eustathius</hi> was not deposed under <hi>Constantius,</hi> but under <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Great, it will then be more then probable that it was not <hi>Arian</hi>) and what reason will the Doctor then leave for <hi>Eustathius,</hi> and the Orthodox People of <hi>Antioch</hi> to give (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that he was duly deposed) why they renounced their Communion, and he govern'd, and they assembled under him in opposition to that Succession? He must conclude them to have been Schismaticks in the doing of it: But then he will own, that there is another reason over and above that of Heresy, (especially <hi>Arianism</hi>) which justify's a separation. And surely (be the Doctors Opinion what it will,) they might have done it, purely and solely, because that Succession was Schismatical and brought in upon <hi>Eustathius</hi> whilst he was alive, and vested with the Government of the <hi>Antiochian</hi> See, upon Church terms: As the Doctor allows he was, till <hi>Meletius</hi> came thither; at which time, and not before, he says <hi>he gave over:</hi> But nothing is more sure, than that the Principles and Practices of the Church of God would have borm then out in it, for that consideration; which have all along opposed <hi>Novatianism</hi> in the same degree, and with the same zeal, they have opposed <hi>Arianism:</hi> And the Characters of each, as of the Heresy, are still found to be given by the Ancient Church, wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the same detestation: And it is also most manifest, that the same Ancients have oppos'd <hi>Novatus,</hi> by reason of his Schism, and for that he brought in Bishops upon full Sees, which were not voyded by Church Laws, to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance of the peace and quiet of the Church of God. And did not <hi>Arius</hi> do the same? Or, was he less a Schismatick than <hi>Novatus,</hi> because he was more an Heretick, and consequently, less hateful, and to be avoyded for it? And I do not in the least question, but that <hi>Eustathius</hi> would no more have comply'd with <hi>Meletius</hi> upon his forcible and uncanonical coming to the See of <hi>Antioch,</hi> had he indeed come to it in such a manner, than he did with <hi>Sophronius</hi> and his Succession; supposing them to have been <hi>Arians:</hi> Or that even <hi>Meletius</hi> did account his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy, alone, sufficient to vouth his Succession, without <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stathius</hi>'s leave, and Resignation. Both which I shall fully make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by and by. Neither do we find, that the Church has been less careful to continue, and maintain, her Succession against <hi>Novatianism,</hi> than she has been against <hi>Arianism.</hi> The Doctors reason may be good which he gives, why <hi>Eustathius</hi> and the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:200314:28"/> Orthodox at <hi>Antioch</hi> did not submit to that Succession, founded in <hi>Sophronius:</hi> (Who was the first <hi>Eusebian</hi> Bishop that came in his Chair) but he makes a perverse improvement of it, when he thence insinuates, or rather directly infers, that the Schism alone of the <hi>Sophronians,</hi> had not been a just ground of their separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them: As though if they had not been <hi>Arians,</hi> the <hi>Eustathians</hi> wou'd have compli'd notwithstanding <hi>Eustathius</hi> was invalidly depos'd, and at the same time a rightful Proprietor, but forcibly remov'd by <hi>Constantine,</hi> and illegally by the Synod, as they afterward did, when <hi>Meletius</hi> came into the See, with <hi>Eustathius</hi> his leave.</p>
                  <p>But this is the Doctors constant way of arguing: And he all a long prov's, with a great deal of weakness and fallacy; that because the Empire hath by its own Authority, without a Synod, placed Bishops in full Sees, not voyded by the Church Laws, but only by its secular removal of the proper Bishops, and the Orthodox have refus'd to receive and submit unto them, and given this reason for it, <hi>Viz.</hi> Because they were <hi>Arians:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (he wou'd infer) these Catholicks wou'd have received the same intruded Bishops or others, in the same Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if they had been Orthodox; and the Schism of the action, and their being <hi>Seconds</hi> in a full See upon an anteceding Church right, not justly extinguished, would not have made a defensive plea, nor justified their non Communion with them. But, might he not as well have argued, that, because adultery is declared to be a sin, which will forfeit that mans salvation who commits it, therefore, Perjury, Drunkenness, Witchcraft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not such noxious sins as Adultery is, because they are not always upon the same occasion, and at the same time, declar'd to have the noxious effect, but passed over and not mention'd, because the Judge thinks fit to arraign and condemn a Criminal as a Traytor, who at the same time, is known to him to be a Felon, Murderer, Sodomist, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he doth not think fit to arraign and condemn him for them, at that Assize, therefore the Criminal is not arraignable, nor lyable to be condemn'd upon those scores?<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect</hi> 4.</note> The Docter himself tells us <hi>that</hi> Acacius <hi>Patriarch of</hi> Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople <hi>refused to Communicate with</hi> Timothy Aelurus, <hi>not because he was put into the place of</hi> Timothy Salofaciolus, <hi>unjustly deposed by the Herretical Usurper</hi> Basilicus, <hi>but because he was an Heretick and a Paricide.</hi> Now, what if his Murther had not been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd there, as well as his Heresy? Why the Doctor, by the parity
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:200314:29"/> of Arguing, must have concluded, that, not his Murther, but his Heresy only, had been a just ground for <hi>Acacius's</hi> rejecting him. But then, he must conclude likewise, that, as not Schism, so, neither were Symony, Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> just ground for it, since they are not mentioned neither: And thus he that arraigns but one sin, at one, and the same time, as damning, must be interpreted to acquit all the rest, though of the same, or the like malignant Influence. And is not this pretty Arguing? But his Book is stuff'd with the same or worse: And we have it heaps upon heaps throughout a great part of it. He ought to have prov'd, that a Bishops Schismatical Possession, upon a bare secular <hi>Deprivation,</hi> is not a just plea for the Believers not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with him, as well as his Arianism; which he can no more do, than he can prove; because Arianism is a most wicked Heresy, therefore Schism brings no guilt with it. But in that he proves the Schismatical possession, not to be a just Plea, because there are more just Pleas, and but one of them is, upon a special occasion, produced as a just one, when that of Schism is not mention'd together with it; this argues only the Doctors rash head, and unthinking Complexion. When a Criminal is brought to the Bar, who is guilty of many Offences that are Capital, the Judg's prudence will direct him to single out one of them, against which the Evidence is most full, and when it's pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment will be more exemplary, and conduce, at least, under the present circumstances, in a greater measure to the common good: And we may easily think, that the same Prudence did direct our Orthodox Believers, in a proportionable degree, to insist upon the <hi>Second</hi>'s <hi>Arianism,</hi> (admitting that they did insist only upon it, which is not prov'd) as the reason why they refus'd to Communicate with him, it being a sin which did then, when the Doctor produces these instances and reasons of it, as visibly appear as the Sun at Noon day, to the no less manifest destruction of the Church, by its Heterodoxy in Faith, and ill effects upon manners, being fill'd with Sacriledge, Rapine, and all sorts of Injustice, which swallow'd up the Schism, and Church Usurpation. And though the Schism had been a competent Plea in its self (and the Catholick Church did at that time no more submit to <hi>Novatianism</hi> than to <hi>Arianism</hi>) yet the <hi>Arianism</hi> might be thought a more seasonable Plea, (<hi>Novatianism</hi> being then Indulg'd by the Empire and made Law, and its abetters, in some other respects, had gain'd a tolerable reputation with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:200314:29"/> the Catholicks) as like to prove a better, and more effectual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for them: and if any that profess'd to be Orthodox have closed with, and submitted to the Schism, when not complicated with the Heresie, the Doctor must prove that they did it upon Principles and Conscience, otherwise his telling of Stories (of which he has abundance) will prove nothing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As to that which the Doctor says, <hi>viz. That</hi> Meletius<hi>'s Orthodoxy, was it which gave him a rightful Title upon his Possession; and accordingly,</hi> Eustathius <hi>and the Orthodox at</hi> Antioch <hi>received him as their lawful Bishop, so soon as they were secured of it.</hi> I shall shew: That as <hi>Meletius</hi>'s <hi>Arianism,</hi> during his Profession of which he was Consecrated<note n="*" place="margin">Soz l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>27.</hi> Baron. an. <hi>360.</hi> num. <hi>44.45.</hi>
                     </note> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> would have been a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and undeniable bar to his own rightful Possession of that Chair, if he had not contrary to the expectation of <hi>Eudoxius</hi> and others, who promoted him as an <hi>Arian</hi> into it, retracted that Heresie, and professed himself a Catholick; and neither <hi>Eusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi>'s deposition, resignation, or death would have removed that bar: So that it was not his Orthodoxy alone, and possession, which made him the legitimate Pastor there, till <hi>Eustathius</hi> gave way unto him, and upon composition, resigned his Right into his hands: but without it, he would have been no better than St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s <hi>Second:</hi> i. e. he would have been a Schismatick, and not a lawful Bishop there, so long as <hi>Eustathius</hi> continued alive, and a Synod did not remove him, upon terms which the Church allows. And this will be readily done, in parts, from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Eustathius</hi>'s relinquishing that See, and <hi>Meletius</hi>'s receiving of it, which the Doctor has given us out of St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and I have recited from his Transcript, a little above, in this Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Where it is most evident, that <hi>Eustathius</hi> continued to inspect and govern the Orthodox in <hi>Antioch,</hi> and they their dependance on him, as their Bishop, until <hi>Meletius</hi> came thither; that <hi>Eusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> did not own <hi>Meletius</hi> as the Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> till it pleased God to bring him off from his <hi>Arianism</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>] and he became a Catholick; that his Orthodoxy alone, and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session (which the <hi>Arians</hi> gave him) did not create his full and just right, until <hi>Eustathius</hi> desisted, and gave up his jurisdiction to him [<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:200314:30"/> is very well consistent with that which the Doctor<note n="*" place="margin">

We cannot think it: For what else could <hi>Meletius</hi> be otherwise but a <hi>Second</hi> in <hi>Antioch,</hi> as <hi>Sophronius</hi> was? Which way could he come into the <hi>Antiochian</hi> district, but by the same injury, which the <hi>Sophronian</hi> Succession had before done to <hi>Eustathius</hi>'s right and person? How infamous must these <hi>Eusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> be, upon their entertaining <hi>Meletius,</hi> who filled the See with the same injustice <hi>Sophronius</hi> did? But they embrac'd the one, and separated from the other, they may not be thought to have done it, without <hi>Eustathius</hi> his consent, and voidance of the Chair, some way or other, if not by a formal resignation, openly made known unto them; especially if we consider their practice a little after; whom we find to adhere to <hi>Meletius,</hi> upon a principle of right, when he had been a long while for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly absent, and <hi>Paulinus</hi> was brought into his See, without his consent, and regular relinquishment of it; though <hi>Paulinus</hi> was not thought to be an <hi>Arian:</hi> they did not believe his Orthodoxy to be sufficient to justifie his coming into a full See, and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Possession, any more than they believed <hi>Meletius</hi>'s possession in opposition to <hi>Eustatbius,</hi> or the <hi>Sophronians,</hi> in opposition to both of them, was their warrant for it.</p>
                  <p>I will here add; that this generous and most Christian action of <hi>Eustathius</hi> seems to have been, in some measure, a president to that proposal which<note n="†" place="margin">Ep. ad Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. apud August. l. de gestis cum Emerito do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natist.</note> St. <hi>Austin</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Bishops made in the days of <hi>Honorius;</hi> who, upon the growth of <hi>Donatism,</hi> and after many attempts and conferences for the adjusting the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences arising upon it, betwixt the <hi>Donatists</hi> and Catholicks, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd this offer, <hi>viz.</hi> that if upon a just stating of their respective

Tho' <hi>Meletius</hi> did not long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that liberty which he then possessed.

                     <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Meletius</hi> whose Character is so great in the Church for Orthodoxy and Integrity, cannot be thought to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on his Orthodoxy alone, upon his possession as a just qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, and competent title to the See of <hi>Antioch,</hi> without <hi>Eustathius</hi>'s resignation; since he did not allow of <hi>Paulinus</hi>'s claim to the same, upon such terms: for <hi>Paulinus</hi> was an <hi>Eustathian</hi> (which sect was entirely Orthodox) and in possession, as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stathius</hi> had been before him; we have shew'd it to be highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that <hi>Eustathius</hi> resign'd, otherwise the <hi>Eustathians</hi> would not have deserted him, and accepted <hi>Meletius</hi> for their Bishop: which is further prov'd by little less than a demonstration, since none may think, that <hi>Meletius</hi> would have oppos'd <hi>Paulinus</hi> as a possessor without right, when at the same time, himself had been no better than a bare possessor in the See of <hi>Antioch,</hi> with equal injury to <hi>Eustathius,</hi> as he pretended <hi>Paulinus</hi> was to him; unless <hi>Eustathius</hi> had resign'd unto him: if <hi>Paulinus</hi>'s title was not good against <hi>Meletius; Meletius</hi>'s title was not good against <hi>Eustathius,</hi> except upon <hi>Eustathius</hi>'s resignation, or his voluntary voidance of his right in <hi>Antioch,</hi> by some way which was equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly.

I answer, that as we have no reason to suspect it, so we have just reason to believe that they had a constant information of his being alive, by Letters or some other way: especially, since we have just grounds, from St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> to believe, that they had correspondence from <hi>Thrace,</hi> whether <hi>Meletius</hi> was exil'd: and, indeed if they had not done it, they could not have acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves of Schism, in making such their distinct worship; <hi>Paulinus</hi> being otherwise unexceptionable, save only that he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed a See, to which another Bishop had a just right, being then alive, only in banishment by the secular Arm. But Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> does not seem to have consider'd any of these things; nor to be concern'd which way they go: believing himself abundantly secur'd, that it makes nothing against <hi>Paulinus</hi>'s title, as a <hi>Possessor,</hi> though <hi>Meletius</hi> was alive together with him, and not rightfully remov'd, upon Church Terms; and his Party did not receive <hi>Paulinus,</hi> but waited for <hi>Meletius</hi>'s return, and adher'd to him in his absence: nor that any thing like an argument is thereby ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred on our side; since they refused <hi>Paulinus</hi> for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which he has produced, and I have a little above recited:<note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</note> and shall here give in my answer to each of them. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first reason (which he is inclinable to conceal,) <hi>viz. That</hi> Paulinus <hi>was esteem'd by some not Orthodox,</hi> ought not indeed to have been nam'd by him: it being the usual practice of the <hi>Arians,</hi> to represent the <hi>Homo♉sians</hi> as <hi>Sabellians,</hi> to make them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:200314:33"/> thereby less acceptable, even odious to their own People; even others that did less incline to Arianism, were very apt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Catholicks to be really such: in that they asserted the Father and the Son to be of <hi>one substance:</hi> because they could not find out any distinction between the three Persons in the Trinity (which the <hi>Sabellians</hi> deny'd) unless they were allow'd to be three distinct Substances; which the Catholick Doctrine of <hi>one substance</hi> altogether precluded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It had been more for the Doctors credit, if he had also passed over, without naming it, that other reason which he has given, why the <hi>Meletians</hi> might oppose <hi>Paulinus,</hi> and refuse to communicate under him upon it, and not upon his unjust pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, <hi>viz. Because he did not allow of the</hi> Meletian <hi>Clergy as being deriv'd from the</hi> Arians. For this could not, in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, be their plea, since <hi>Paulinus</hi> was one of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Synod, which determin'd, that those who had so far comply'd, with the <hi>Arians,</hi> as to receive orders from them, should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, upon their repentance, with their orders, and remain Priests in their former stations; of which we have the account in<note n="*" place="margin">Ep.

For it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that if <hi>Meletius,</hi> the ejected Bishop, did not refuse <hi>Paulinus</hi> the <hi>Successor,</hi> as an intruder on his Church Right, and in that instance of the sin, a Schismatick: he had sufficient ground to do it, as he was a Schismatick in the foremention'd instance of it: and <hi>Paulinus</hi>'s Orthodoxy would have vindicated him against <hi>Melerius,</hi> no otherwise than <hi>Lucifer</hi>'s Orthodoxy did him, against the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>I have already observed, how <hi>Baronius</hi> all along, contends to have <hi>Paulinus</hi> the Catholick Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> though he owns <hi>Meletius</hi> to have been alive at the same time: and I cannot but further take notice with what impotency and meanness of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he pursues it: as, when he gives this for one of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,<note place="margin">

Does not the <hi>Annalist</hi> tell us so? But the learn'd Cardinal had recorded it as true History,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus</hi> did enthrone <hi>Paulinus</hi> in the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Chair, as the Pope's Legate; and he is bound to make the performance as passable as he can; though his attempts do make but the whole more incredible, as it is usual for those to do, that embarque in a bad cause: And, notwithstanding a most establisht principle in the Church is violated by it, and two Bishops are in one Chair at the same time, he is abundantly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd, that his <hi>Holiness</hi>'s appearance in the Cause, is a competent dispensation for it all. And I think it will be the Doctors best way to take up his refuge there also, and vouch his <hi>Successor</hi> (at least at <hi>Antioch</hi>) by the same authority: I am sure he may do it by as good argument as he uses, when he proves, in the next place, that the <hi>Meletians</hi> did not refuse communion with <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> on the score of his being an Usurper, and unjustly possessed of <hi>Meletius</hi>'s Chair; because they refused him, as pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

How do these two reasons exclude one another? The Doctor may see how they do, but no body else can, if <hi>Meletius</hi> had been dead, they could not be said to refuse <hi>Paulinus</hi> for both reasons, but only for the latter: But so long as he was alive they might have refused him for both reasons, for what any man alive can discern, but himself, in the two reasons, as rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their doing of it, upon the account of them, inconsistent: And why he urges <hi>Lucifers</hi> supposed powerless enthroning him, as an Argument that they did not receive him, because he was an intruder upon <hi>Meletius,</hi> he seems only able to give an account. Besides; does not the Doctor wonderfully forget his main <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomenon:</hi> viz. <hi>That</hi> Possession <hi>and</hi> Orthodoxy <hi>create a right, and oblige the Subjects to receive the present Bishop under these two qualifications, though the predecessor be unjustly remov'd, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the</hi> Possessor <hi>was unduly enthron'd?</hi> I always thought that the Principle which they have advanced, had obliged them to receive him that is in the Chair, i. e. the <hi>Possessor,</hi> if other ways <hi>unexce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptionable.</hi> And how comes it then to pass that the Doctor pleads, that the <hi>Meletians</hi> might refuse <hi>Paulinus</hi> when <hi>possessed</hi> by <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and was every waies else unexceptionable, save that he had not a <hi>Right</hi> to do it?

                  <p>To come home, to our own Kingdome; epecially sin Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> has made one of his Instances here: No man will say, but that <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk was rightfully constituted Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, who was an outlandish Bishop, <hi>i. e.</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi> we to be sure may not say otherwise, since we claim the Succession of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops from him; And because the Succession had fail'd, and Christianity with it, by reason of the banishment, and other hard usage, the Bishops had receiv'd upon the return of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenism, which then mostly reign'd in this <hi>Island:</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of the Christian Religion was sufficient to warrant it. And there is not any thing in that performance which makes these two great Men to appear blame worthy, but that <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> claim'd a right to it, as his own peculiar, exclusive to the rest of the Bishops of Christendom, And pleaded a power from the same bottom, as derived from <hi>Christ</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> to him, enabling him to inspect and animadvert upon all of them, and to be unaccountable for it; even to demand a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection from them: And <hi>Austin,</hi> in pursuance of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from him, extended it to <hi>Wales:</hi> And exercised it Autoratively and Arbitrarily over the Pastors, and Believers, and their Archbishop there, who were duly and regularly seated in a just polity, rightful government and subordination, the sincere profession of the Orthodox Faith, and in a lawful Succession. The sum of the whole matter is this.</p>
                  <p>No Bishop, by the Canons of the Church, may act out of his district, except in Barbarous Regions, in which there is no Bishop: Or when another, district is over run with Heresy and Schism, to the hazarding of the Catholick Faith and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession; under which emergencies he may, and ought upon a possibility of success, to extend his care, and exercise his Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Function, without his pale; even by constituting his own Officers there; as the forementioned eminent Bishops and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors have done: And, not only their practice, but the polity of Christendom will bear him out in it: A Reformation is otherwise impracticable, upon an Apostasy of one or more Churches; if the State of the World be such, that Synods cannot be had: Unless we shou'd follow <hi>Baronius,</hi> and call in the Popes universal Pastorship and Superintendency for that purpose: And therefore that<note n="*" place="margin">

It is manifest that these things did not come into Doctor <hi>Hody</hi>'s thoughts: If they had, he would not, surely, have urged it as unlawful in all cases, for a forrein Bishop to act beyond his District: and we can allow him to defend a Successor possessing a full See, upon the foremention'd Considerations.

And is it not again as evident to the same common apprehensions, that as he remain'd a Bishop, in the full extent of his right, notwithstanding his exile, and it did not in the least intercept it, but his People own'd and obey'd him, as their Bishop, during the whole time of his absence, so, that such his right is no ways owing to his return by the favour of the Empire: And that his People cannot be conceived to have thought it was? <hi>Meletius</hi>'s being <hi>upon the road homewards</hi> could not create that right in him, which he had in <hi>Armenia,</hi> nor be the reason why <hi>Paulinus</hi> was rejected, and himself received by his <hi>Antiochians:</hi> Nothing but the Doctors Ignorance of the Story, and matter of Fact, or his rash and undigested thoughts, could occasion him to produce this as an instance, upon such an occasion.</p>

The whole matter of Fact is this, as it may be found in St. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> in the abovemention'd <hi>Homily. When the Governor of the

But what did the blessed Bishop do? Seeing the cast of stones, he folded up his Garments, and cover'd the Presidents head with them, and made his enemies ashamed by that his eminent Instance of his own meekness: and taught them and his people at once what patience they ought to shew towards them that do them injury: and that they ought, not only to do them no hurt, but even when they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from other men, to rescue them from it, with their best endeavour.</hi>

I shall stay here a little, and observe, the thing it self is very plain, <hi>viz.</hi> That the separation which we find to have been in the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> and Anti-communion, was not made by the respective parties, upon the account of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie in either of the Bishops; since there is nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, than that <hi>Meletius</hi> and <hi>Paulinus</hi> were Orthodox at that time: for if they had not, but Heresie had been the bar to their union, care would have been taken, upon the accommodation, for the removing of it; otherwise the Schism must have remain'd as before, because the Heresie, the occasion of it, would have remain'd; if <hi>Paulinus</hi> had not taken up that error which <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus</hi> afterwards improv'd into a rupture in the Church, and believ'd that <hi>Meletius</hi> ought not to be own'd as a true Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, nor communicated with, because he was ordain'd by the <hi>Arian</hi> Bishops: it is well known that <hi>Lucifer</hi> was never censur'd as an Heretick for it, but only as a Schismatick. Since then both were Orthodox, the Schism must have remain'd, or never have been, or some other ground, besides their Heresy, is to be assign'd for it. And if Orthodoxy alone, as such, would have legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated a Communion with them, they would have been as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Bishops before the stipulation, as after it. And yet Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> very frequently insists, and with a great deal of assurance, (as I have before observ'd) that those many Catholicks, whom he owns to have rejected such Bishops as possessed Sees in injury to others then alive, and who were their rightful Bishops, might, and would have receiv'd them, if they had been Orthodox, <hi>i. e.</hi> they had not been <hi>Arians:</hi> for if so, what made this distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in <hi>Antioch?</hi> Or, what ground was there for a Church debate about it? Or, what pleas had the Orthodox there for their not communicating before, as afterwards, but the supposed unjust, and therefore Schismatical possessions of the opposite
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:200314:40"/> Bishops? Or, how were things alter'd, upon the common agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Church determination? Or, how will the Doctor go about to make any one believe, (who is not resolv'd afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to be of his Party) that since the <hi>Arians,</hi> upon their Ordinations into full Sees, erected and continued a Succession against the Catholick Succession, in the same notorious and visible manner as the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatists</hi> did; those <hi>Arians</hi> were not also to be rejected for their Schism in so doing, though they had no Heresy, as he must own the Catholick Church had all along refused to own and Communicate with these <hi>Donatists</hi> and <hi>Novatians,</hi> purely and solely upon the account of their Schism? Neither is any thing more sure, than that this Anti-communion in <hi>Antioch,</hi> was also founded upon the same bottom of Schism on the one or the other side, in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, at least, of the two respective Bishops, and their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And <hi>Paulinus</hi> either pleaded his Possession, to which <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letius</hi> could not submit, because, though he was absent at the time of <hi>Paulinus</hi>'s enthroning, he was alive, and had not resign'd, and was then present and demanded his Right. Or else <hi>Paulinus</hi> might plead that <hi>Meletius</hi> was Ordain'd by <hi>Arian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: But none of these pleas could amount to any more than Schism: for, in all other respects, the Competitors were unsuspected, and believed to be as entire and untainted, as in their faith.</p>

We have here an Instance of the Churches Right and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in disposing of Bishopricks, and making them more or fewer, as her prudence shall see occasion, for the better service of the Faith: And the same City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which had but one Bishop ever since the Believers were first <hi>call'd Christians</hi> there upon St. <hi>Peters</hi> preaching to them in the Acts of the Apostles, hath now two Bishops lawfully, and truly, consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, (besides the false ones of the<note n="*" place="margin">Theod.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:200314:41"/> this will readily appear to be a mistake: For that Canon was so phrased in compliance with the general custom of the Church in those days, according to which, every City had a Bishop;<note place="margin">Can. <hi>12.</hi> Apost.

Now after this Schism thus ended, the same deposition and banishment of <hi>Meletius</hi> occasion'd another: for in his absence, <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus</hi> coming to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it without a Bishop, upon a presumption, surely, that <hi>Mele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was then dead, he enthron'd <hi>Paulinus</hi> in that Chair: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the <hi>Eustathians,</hi> who had adher'd to <hi>Eustathius</hi> their Bishop, and to <hi>Meletius</hi> as his true Successor, divided themselves into two parties, but went under the name of <hi>Eustathians;</hi> and the one

                  <p>Thus our good God, by vertue of his promise once made to his Church, always preserves a due succession, by the means of some choice men, whom he raises up for that purpose: and his wisdom finds a way by which her disent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But he argues, as he usually does, upon a mistaken bottom: For,</p>

Was it not his faylure, to yeild to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Emergency, and Resign? Ought he not, with the other Bishops, who stood out, to have adher'd to <hi>Paulinus,</hi> against <hi>Flavianus,</hi> and asserted his Right, which he own'd, not by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating; but, by continuing in his Chair, and in the exercise of his Jurisdiction; so long as he might have done it without sin, and he was not disenabled in his person to do it, by the force of his Enemies? Would he not have done more service to the Church of God by it, then by resigning? If every Christian Bishop should be of his mind, under the same, or the like, Exigency, what would become of the Unity, Government, the, even, being of the Church of God? He is really, and indispensably, imitable in opposing <hi>Flavianus,</hi> and not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in the guilt, which he would have necessarily incurr'd, by abetting a Schismatical Possessor, whose Chair was full, upon his Possession; but might he not have found out a better and more approv'd way of mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If St. <hi>Gregory</hi> had been in possession of <hi>Antioch,</hi> as <hi>Paulinus</hi> was; or those <hi>Aegyptian</hi> and <hi>Macedonian</hi> Bishops, whom he<note n="‖" place="margin">Ibid. num. <hi>153.</hi>
                     </note> mentions, had unduly depriv'd him, and brought <hi>Flavianus,</hi> or another Bishop, into his See, being full, as they brought <hi>Flavianus</hi> into <hi>Antioch,</hi> and St. <hi>Gregory</hi> had resign'd, and receiv'd them; upon this his example, there might be some shew of a plea, for the validity of <hi>unjust and uncanonical Deprivations;</hi> and our deprived Bishops, might be urg'd to resign likewise, with an appearance of some reason for it, upon St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s example: But it is altogether unaccountable, that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> should be urg'd as their Pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n for it, since it cannot be prov'd that he would have resign'd upon such considerations; since his Resignation was not made upon any such considerations; since we have all the reason in the world to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he would not, because he censur'd and condemn'd such an intrusion in <hi>Flavianus,</hi> and loaded it with the foulest guilt, as I have above given an account, and may be seen<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. supra.</note> more largely: Did he not refuse to receive him as his Collegue? And the avoiding the Schism of that action is one reason of his resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And the other old Bishops, that were overvoted by the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:200314:47"/> younger, did not receive <hi>Flavianus,</hi> but made a separation from them upon it; as it is well known in our Church Story. And all the use that I know the Doctor can make of this <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolitan</hi> affair, and St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Resignation, is; that, since St. <hi>Gregory</hi> made an invective against the Majority of the second General Council which was held there, and condemn'd it, in that it brought <hi>Flavianus</hi> into a full See, <hi>Paulinus,</hi> the righful Proprietor, being then alive; and for that reason, among some others, chose rather to quit his Bishoprick, then to seem, by holding it, and communicating with those Bishops, who did it, to countenance, and partake of the sin of so vile an action; since St. <hi>Gregory</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Epist. <hi>55.</hi> ad Procop.</note> was so highly offended with the Council for it, and not being able to master his resentment, in the heat of his passion, resolved never to come into a Synod more, and hastily said, that he never knew one that had a good event. Such a sense had he of the impiety of this proceeding; what then? Therefore, the Prince, the <hi>Mob,</hi> any thing that hath power enough, may without plea of right, deprive a Bishop, and bring in a Possessor, and the Depriv'd is oblig'd to resign, and receive, and communicate with him: Surely, a hopeful consequence: But tho' the Doctor has not, we have learn'd to make better use of the rash proceedings of these temporizing young Bishops, and the Elder's mean compliance with them, which is.</p>
                  <p>That the Nature and Constitution of the Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and the obligation of Obedience to its Decisions, even those that are made in a General Council, do not engage a Christian at large, nor yet a Christian Officer and Bishop, who is a Member of that Council, to submit unto them upon the forementioned terms: I mean when a pack of pretended Converts, shall, by their number and turbulency, to vindicate thereby their own naughty practices of the same nature, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw a first principle, receiv'd from Christ, together with the incorporation, which he instituted and founded in his Blood; and erect a false Communion under <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollos;</hi> or in opposition to them, or any one of them, by deserting the proper Bishop, or bringing in a false Bishop upon him; so that two Bishops are in the same District, at the same time: Even, the most holy of Bishops have not a right to determine, and oblige, the subject upon such terms. And tho' the hundred and fifty, which made this General
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:200314:48"/> Council at <hi>Constantinople</hi> (for, notwithstanding that our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians failing often in our <hi>Chronology,</hi> give us some occasion to think this Vote was passed in a Council held at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> subsequent to the other just now mentioned, called the third Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the<note n="†" place="margin">Vid.

                     </note> contrary is made apparent) I say, though those Bishops had been Orthodox in their Faith, and unspotted in their manners, and had then made the Decision; St. <hi>Gregory</hi> had forfeited his Title, <hi>the Divine,</hi> if he had not declar'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their proceedings, and the improbity of them; and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented from them in the same manner he hath done.</p>
                  <p>It is own'd to be the proper work of a General Council to determine the rights of Bishops, when they fall under debate, and the Bishops and Clergy of the Neighbourhood cannot do it: And thus the cases of <hi>Maximus Cynicus,</hi> and St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianzum</hi> were adjusted by the same Council of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> when <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and his <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bishops had consecrated <hi>Maximus</hi> Bishop there, upon their own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Schismatically; and he was ejected upon the Antient Church Rules and Grounds, and <hi>Gregory</hi> fixed in that See: The Synod could no more have settled them both in it, by bringing the one upon the other, vested with the same rights, to be promiscuously exercised by both, and in opposition to one another▪ contrary to the antecedent immutable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment founded in <hi>Christ</hi>

And we have this advantage by it; that as our Church in her <hi>one and thirtieth Article</hi> hath said, that <hi>General Councils may erre, and sometimes have erred in things perteining to God,</hi> so a Cardinal of <hi>Rome</hi> hath acknowledg'd the same. For, surely, <hi>Romes</hi> Universal Pastorship is accounted by him to be among the things that pertain to God. Is it not reputed by the <hi>Romanist</hi> as a first Truth, even no less then an Article of Faith?</p>
                  <p>And now, I have done with these five Bishops, <hi>viz. Eusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius, Meletius, Paulinus, Flavianus</hi> and <hi>Evagrius,</hi> who made great figures in their times; and not only <hi>Antioch,</hi> but the whole Church has been concern'd upon some Emergencies, which happn'd by reason of them. I did not think that I should have insisted so long here as I have done: But new considerations still arose, and I was the more willing to dwell upon them, because the Doctor even triumphs, upon the advantages which he thinks he has from them: Though it is upon a bottom, which I have shew'd to be sandy all along, but here more particularly: Indeed, each circumstance, throughout the whole Story, strengthens our cause against him: And if any one shall so far concern himself with that, which I have here taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and made my observations upon, as to think it too long; I expect, that the weightiness, and present usefulness of of the matter should be some plea for me: The subject is comprehensive enough to make a distinct Tract, and deserves
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:200314:49"/> it: I am not ignorant that some part of it is variously related by our Historians: Especially that concerning <hi>Eustathius:</hi> and if any find fault that I have not clear'd the Story, as he may think I ought to have done, because I suppose some things, and acquiesce in them, as truth's, which are impugn'd by others; I need not undertake a vindication of my self upon this account: For, if there were two <hi>Eustathius's,</hi> the one Bishop of <hi>Sebastia,</hi> the other of <hi>Antioch;</hi> it is no matter, then, where the former was, when <hi>Meletius</hi> was made Bishop of <hi>Antioch:</hi> That See could not then be filled by him: Again, if there was but one <hi>Eustathius,</hi> and he was translated from <hi>Sebastia,</hi> or deposed, and upon repentance admitted to <hi>Beraea,</hi> and thence to <hi>Antioch,</hi> by the Council of <hi>Nicea:</hi> Whether he was afterwards legally deposed and remov'd from <hi>Antioch,</hi> in <hi>Constantine's</hi> days, or illegally and ineffectually, but, being banish'd, never appear'd, and his Chair became a <hi>Derelictum;</hi> or, whether he was dead and voyded it that way; or remain'd alive, and appear'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but resign'd his right of <hi>Antioch,</hi> before <hi>Meletius</hi> was righfully possessed of it: as it is variously argu'd and concluded; if, I say, any of them hold, it must sink the Doctor's plea, which he makes with a great deal of assurance: <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Eustathius was invalidly depriv'd, and alive, and exercised his function over the</hi> Antiochians, <hi>and had not resign'd, when</hi> Meletius <hi>was possessed of that See:</hi> And consequently, <hi>Meletius</hi>'s, coming to <hi>Antioch</hi> is not a competent plea for the Doctor's <hi>Second,</hi> or <hi>Successor.</hi> And the great and most Catholick Principle; <hi>viz.

                  <p>I Come now, in this second Chapter, according to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed Method, to shew, that during the Reigns of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> and <hi>Constantius,</hi> the Empire was not reputed, upon Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Principles, and by the Catholicks of that time, (or even by most of the Hereticks) to be vested with a Right to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate a Bishop, when a Possessor; and by virtue of such his Abdication, or Deposition, to acquit his people of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him: No, though he was in his person, rendred uncapable to exercise his Pastoral Function among them. Nor
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:200314:49"/> was the said Secular Power thought to be competent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne a Bishop, and righfully possess him of an Episcopal Chair, though it was vacant upon terms which the Church allows, nor could it by virtue of that Possession enable him to demand obedience of the Officers, and other Believers, within that District; nor to lay an obligation on the said Officers and Believers, to receive and obey him; it being only the Church hands, that were then believed to be capable of doing this: And further, that if any Emperor, or other incompetent Power, has attempted, and effected such a thing, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd, or, dipossess'd a Bishop; a competent number of the Colledge, or Episcopal Fraternity, and of others Christians, that were truly conscientious, did always remonstrate upon Gospel principles, and adhere notwithstanding to the righful Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and reject the Interloper.</p>
                  <p>Now, in pursuance of this, I shall begin with <hi>Constantine</hi> whose principle was asserted and manifested by him, in the case of <hi>Caecilianus</hi> and <hi>Majorinus,</hi> when both of them were vested by their several Parties, and contended for their respectives rights in the Archbishoprick of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and the latter call'd the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror in as their Judge; being well assur'd, that the whole action will be found an undeniable and irrefragable evidence on our side. For, in this great affair <hi>Constantine</hi> did not stand a neuter, <hi>but disclaim'd all right to be a Judge in it;</hi> as what belong'd only to Church-men, and would be an <hi>Ʋsurpation</hi> upon the Law of God in him, if he should undertake it. And for the making this appear, I need only state the case, and declare the proceedings upon it, on the Churches, and on the Emperor's side: Which is this, according to the account that our Church-Historians, if St. <hi>Austin</hi> may be reckon'd among them, have given us of it.<note n="*" place="margin">Vid.

                  <p>But these turbulent men did not desist; tho' the Catholick Bishops had, in two Councils, determin'd and declar'd against them; they being in the number of those, who may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, but cannot be overcome, because their work is always to resist the truth. And as they had before appeal'd from the Council at <hi>Rome</hi> to the Emperor's Person; they again make another ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from this Council of <hi>Arelatum:</hi> and tho' <hi>Constantine</hi> did not think that they were less impious and unreasonable in this appeal, than they were in the former; or that himself was better qualify'd to judge in a Church case than he was before; yet, upon a full experience that their prejudices to the Church Judges was so great that their Decisions would have

Hereupon, the most Religious Emperor (tho' unwillingly)<note n="*" place="margin">August. Ep. <hi>162.</hi>
                     </note> condescended to their request; but not without regret for his seeming to intermeddle with the Bishops Province, and asking them pardon for it. And he first appointed <hi>Rome</hi> for the place of hearing, and gave each party orders to appear there; but <hi>Caecilianus</hi> did not come; and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> would not proceed against him when absent, as the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> had done before: So that Assembly prov'd ineffectual, for which St. <hi>Austin</hi> seems much concern'd, wishing that he had then declar'd his judgment, and thereby put an end to their mad animosities, since they had engag'd themselves to submit unto it, and could not go back without a great blemish upon them.

But as his judgment here concurr'd with the two Synods precedeing, so it had no better effect; for they censur'd him upon it as corrupt, partial, and unjust.

                  <p>AND thus, I think, I have abundantly made it to appear, to any, who shall peruse this account, and desire satisfaction; that the right to constitute and remove a Bishop was solely in the Church, during <hi>Constantine</hi>'s reign; unless they can produce their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or secret History, in opposition to that, which our best Authors have openly deliver'd of those affairs. And I do heartily wish, that two sorts of men would seriously consider it, and lay aside their frequent discourses, in which they declare themselves of another opinion, and contradict that which is wrote as with a Sun beam, in the eyes of all men that can, and will, see it.</p>
                  <p>One sort of these men say, <hi>That the Church exercis'd a right, or rather a power, whilst the Empire was Heathen: But it became an</hi> Escheat <hi>to</hi> Constantine, <hi>when he became a Christian, and hath since remain'd in his Succession; and now is actually subjected in every Prince that is Christian, of what Line, Age, or Country soever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how came <hi>Constantine</hi> to be ignorant of this accumulated right upon his becoming a Christian? or, if he knew it, why did he forego it, nay abdicate it, since his conversion deriv'd and warranted it unto him? To say nothing of the Emperors that were his Successors, whose case was the same. Or were the Bishops in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s, and the succeeding reigns, ignorant of this? Or, which will be a great deal worse, did they know, but conceal it, and usurp upon the Empire, by the exercise of that power, which they knew to belong unto it, and themselves had no right in? This Character will not become these holy Men: But their enemies would have been glad to have met with such men as <hi>Mr. Selden, Mr. Hobbs,</hi> and some other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellists, and receiv'd the information from them; for none then among them were able to have given them these new lights. It would have effectually prov'd that charge against them some so much desir'd to make out, and so frequently attempted, but could find no bottom to build it upon, <hi>viz.</hi> That they acted by principles very prejudicial to the Government.</p>
                  <p>The other sort of men (which, I hope, may in time be better advis'd) are those that say no less, to the Church's disreputation; <hi>viz. That the Bishops did relinquish their original right to the Empire,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:200314:53"/> and wholly quit it, when the Emperors became Christian; even by a kind of</hi> Simoniacal <hi>compact, being brib'd unto it, by the temporal Possessions and Immunities, with which they vested them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now tho' I will not undertake to answer for the integrity of every Bishop, as to this matter, especially in the two Reigns of <hi>Constantius,</hi> and <hi>Valens;</hi> under which, too many will be found to have waver'd, during their persecutions, (tho' a competent number did not) their worldly Interests having over much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon them: Yet they had no temptation to do it under <hi>Constantine,</hi> whose principles directed him (and his practice was accordingly, save once, in <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s case, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Tyre</hi>) to support, and preserve them entire, in those liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with which <hi>Christ</hi> had endow'd them; and they would have incurr'd his utmost displeasure, if they had deliver'd up one of them. So that this Plea also is altogether precarious. And surely the case of <hi>Caecilianus</hi> and <hi>Majorinus</hi> is so full an evidence of the Church's immutable Right, <hi>exclusive</hi> to the State, and the inviolated preservation of it, that nothing can be more so. For 1. <hi>Caecilianus</hi> was enthron'd at <hi>Carthage</hi> by the neighbouring Bishops, and by their hands only, upon the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of that Chair, by the death of <hi>Mensurius:</hi> And this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> himself has own'd to have been done according to <hi>Christ</hi>'s Institution.<note n="*" place="margin">Ep. ad Episc. Catholicos supr.</note> And farther when <hi>Donatus,</hi> and his Party, op<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>posed <hi>Caecilianus</hi> in bringing <hi>Majorinus</hi> upon him, he tells them <hi>That they did thereby so far wickedly and perversely desert the Holy Religion, the Heavenly Power, and the Catholick Determination.</hi>

                     </note> As in his Epistle to <hi>Chrestus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> above mention'd; with a great deal more to the same effect; which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready recited.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Bishops, and they alone, were the Judges, and had a right to determine, judicially, upon any doubt that seemingly, or really, might arise concerning <hi>Caecilianus</hi>'s Title, to confirm it, or voyd it, and place a <hi>Successor</hi> upon him: And <hi>Constantine</hi> admonisheth, censureth, and condemns the <hi>Donatists</hi> for asserting the same right in himself, and supplicating him to execute it; for which he represents them as men <hi>that are hardned,</hi> destitute of the <hi>Sunshine-light</hi> of the Gospel, and of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Clemency,</hi> and haters of the <hi>Provision which Christ hath made for that purpose by his Church.</hi> Of which, and more, I have also given an account above.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Constantine</hi> removes this right and power quite from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:200314:54"/> and disowns it, as that which no ways belongs to him. It seems then that the Coordinate Power of the Church and State in the exercise of it, which Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> speaks of, was unknown to this great Emperor, when he says <hi>That the</hi> Civil<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>and</hi> Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical <hi>Persons are</hi> Governors <hi>alike; and the latter exceeds the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer only in that those have a superadded right</hi> to administer the Sacraments and ordain the Clergy: <hi>And if the Emperor had thought fit to have exercised his right in the Ecclesiastical Government, and depos'd</hi> Cornelius; <hi>St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>would have own'd, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his deprivation</hi>

                     <hi>as reasonable and just.</hi> And tho' I can't answer his demand<note n="‖" place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 41.</note> and make it appear. <hi>That the Church hath ever refus'd to submit to the present Possessor, because his Pre: decessor was unjustly depos'd by the secular Power;</hi> we have prov'd the secular Power incompetent to deprive him: and if he does prove that St <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or any one, or more Bishops, have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, (tho' I'll engage he cannot prove it upon St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>) their examples will not be argumentative: and he had as good let it alone.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All that <hi>Constantine</hi> did, or was capable to do, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> and <hi>Majorinus,</hi> in the way of Judicature, was to confirm the anteceeding judicial Acts of the Bishops, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate them, by his secular Laws and Penalties.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And lastly. It is here also to be consider'd, that this Power, of which we have been discoursing, thus exercis'd by the Bishops, and disclaim'd by <hi>Constantine</hi> himself, related purely and solely to the fixing a Bishop in his See. <hi>i. e.</hi> To that one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular branch of the rights and power of the Priesthood, by which one Bishop is enabled to give possession to another; and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop so possess'd receives a right to govern the Officers subjected to him, and the Believers within his own District, and they become oblig'd to pay their duty of subjection to him. The Empire could then no more do it (at least in its own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions) then it could administer the Sacraments, or give holy Orders. 'Tis true the right of Investiture is so far in the Prince, as it extends to the Bishop's Temporals, and no other hand but his can legally possess a Bishop of them, and give him a civil forinsick right unto them: But as it extends to his Spirituals, the Prince can no more invest him with them, than he can give him the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> or a Power to dispense any other of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Institutions. And we are most sure, that the Catholicks did not refuse to communicate with <hi>Majorinus</hi> because <hi>he</hi> was an
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:200314:54"/> Heretick, (tho' Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> often contends they did refuse Communion with several Schismatical Bishops brought in upon a full See, as <hi>Majorinus</hi> was, not because of their Schism, or want of a Title, but because of their heresie) since no one pretends that the <hi>Donatists</hi> were any ways Heretical; at least when this Controversie of Church Right was started by them: Tho' St <hi>Austin</hi>

                     </note> afterwards calls them Hereticks, by reason of their continu'd, obstinate, and invincible Schism; as also in that they maintain'd several Errors, concerning the nature of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, as rebaptizations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they did not broach till that cause was ended.</p>

                  <p>I Cannot omit one instance more in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s days: It is that of his proceedings against <hi>Athanasius;</hi> which great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, we know, fell so far under his displeasure, thro' the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and craft of his restless Adversaries, (especially the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> who had gain'd too much upon the good Emperor, and thereby lay'd their design to restore <hi>Arianism,</hi> but did not effect it till the latter end of <hi>Constantius</hi>'s Reign,) that <hi>Constantine</hi> gave way to that great Prelate's deposition, for several crimes exhibited, but never prov'd against him.

                  </p>
                  <p>From whence these following observables are easy and manifest.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>Constantine</hi> cannot be conceiv'd to have chang'd his Opinion in his latter days, and maintain a direct and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate right in himself to abdicate a Bishop, and absolve his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their duty to him, since he not only call'd this Council of <hi>Tyre</hi> on pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>pose for <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s abdication, (which makes a strong presumption that he did not think his own Power to be competent for it) but in that he acted mediately only, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly▪ by the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shops hands: And either provided that the Synod should be made up of his own Creatures; or else he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd his Prefect, and inferior secular Officers to overawe, and over rule their votes, menacing terrors and penalties against them, when they did not answer his design. For what needed he to have proceded in this manner, if his single Edict had been a Law to the Church, as it was to the State? Can any account be given of these his Artifices, mean complyances, and his servile dependence on the <hi>Eusebian</hi> Bishops? Or of the meaning of his threats to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, if he could of himself, have effectually depos'd <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:200314:55"/> or the Bishops had not had a right, and power to obstruct his Deposition, separate, and independent upon the Emperour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If it be said here, (as it usually is upon other occasions) that <hi>Constantine</hi> did not understand his own Rights in the Church; or else that he gave them up to her discretion, being guided by an over ruling zeal, or, as some may say, by a particular interest. The first cannot be pleaded; since it is not likely that his whole Court knew no better, or that it did not inform him; or that it would at the same time preclude the Empire's right and truckle under those that usurpt it; especially under the Bishops, whose Lordship it could least endure. And for the latter, he was so far from giving all up to the Church's discretion, that he gain'd a Majority in the Council by menaces and violence. The <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Bishops only were they that acted freely, and their votes were implicitely receiv'd and submited to, thro' the present distress of those who complied with them. And by these means the cause was gain'd against <hi>Athanasius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is hence very plain, that <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, in the case of <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> and <hi>Majorinus</hi> (of which an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is given above) was purely upon Church principles; since <hi>Athanasius</hi> does contend here, and declare for <hi>the same;</hi> and we are to think that the other Catholick Bishops, which were in the Synod, and adhered to him, nay protested against the <hi>Eusebians</hi> proceedings, amongst whom the famous <hi>Paphnutius</hi> was one, did not come behind him in it. What less doth our most Holy <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Patriarch say, than that the secular Power is not to intermeddle with the deposing of a Bishop, either by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror in Person, or by his Substitutes, but that it is the work of the Bishops alone.</p>
                  <p>Besides, since <hi>Athanasius</hi>

                     </note> appeal'd from this Pseudo-Synod to <hi>Constantine;</hi> we may not think that his protestation against his right to depose, was, even in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s opinion, in injury to him; if it had been thought so by him, we cannot believe that he would have shew'd so much kindness to him as he did afterwards. <hi>Constantine</hi> the Son tells us, that his Father design'd to recal <hi>Athanasius,</hi> but he was prevented by his death; and that he did not banish him to <hi>Trevers</hi> as a guilty man, but to preserve him from the Rabble in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and farther, that it was upon his own experience in <hi>France</hi> (where <hi>Constantine</hi> the Son's Government lay) of <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s eminent virtues, that he accomplisht his Father's design, and sent him back in

                  <p>I thought to have concluded this Chapter here; but I cannot forbear, upon further considerations, to desire the Reader to compare the follwing Account of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Constantine;</hi> in which he will find them to have had the same sentiments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Rights of the Church, as to our present Case, tho' they liv'd, at least, sixty years asunder; St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> when <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatianus</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> were brought into his and <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Sees, whilst they were alive, and possess'd them upon Church terms: <hi>Constantine,</hi> when <hi>Majorinus</hi> was brought into <hi>Caecilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s See, <hi>Caecilianus</hi> being the rightful Possessor of it, and the <hi>Donatists</hi> supplicated him to undertake their cause: And <hi>both</hi> of them are <hi>positive,</hi> that none but a Church Right can fix a Bishop in a District, or deprive him: Even a Church Right cannot bring a Bishop into a See that is then legally fill'd: But if the Prince, or any other Power that is worldly, does fix or deprive a Bishop, and a People does receive and obey him, or reject and disobey him, upon that Authority, they herein act in opposition to God and Christ, and the Church; whose Laws have provided otherwise.</p>

                  <p>Now, upon a just consideration of this state, and these rights of the Church and the Empire, with respect to the filling and vacating Sees, or accepting and rejecting Bishops, in the time of our Eminent Archbishop St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, and first Christian Emperor, as themselves have given us an account of them; and a due comparing their Judgments and Determinations concerning them, as they are above set down, from their own pens; it will appear very plain and evident, to a demonstration, That those Rights, and that Power, which the Christian Bishops, in the <hi>Cyprianick</hi> Age exercis'd to the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd purpose under <hi>Rome Heathen,</hi> remain'd in the Bishops, and <hi>only</hi> in them; and were exercis'd by them, under <hi>Rome Christian,</hi> in the days of <hi>Constantine:</hi> They then became neither an escheat to the Empire, nor were delivered into its hands, by the Bishops, upon its becoming Christian: but, as the practice of the Church and of the Empire, so the Laws of both continu'd their execution, as subjected before in the Church: Even the immediate and and eternal Law of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> provided for it.

                  </p>
                  <p>For the prof of this, and that <hi>Constantius</hi> did not really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he was vested with a Right to exercise the deposing power on a Bishop, and by removing him from his Bishoprick to make way for a Successor; tho' his passion and Interest did now and then push him on to make some attempts that way: I will proceed on the Instance of <hi>Athanasius, omitting others</hi> at present. Now it is well known that <hi>Constantius</hi> had a peculiar disgust against this holy Man, insomuch that he peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:200314:59"/> resolv'd that he should be dispossest, and finally remov'd; tho' he condescended some time before, by the Intercession of his Brother <hi>Constantine,</hi> that he should be releas'd from that exile in <hi>France,</hi> which his Father had lay'd him under, and return to his Church and People of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> But did he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess and endeavour to effect his removal afterwards as by a Right, connate, and coeval to his Empire, and vested in a <hi>Decius</hi> or a <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> would have us believe? Or as escheated from the Church to him upon his receiving Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> would have it? Or by the submission and resignation of the Bishops then in being, as others suggest? Did he attempt it by any other hands then those of the Bishops? Even when he used his own upon other occasions, was it any other waies, <hi>then by offering violence to the hands of the Bishops,</hi> and haling them in, that they might lift them up in voting on his side, as his Father had done before him in the Council of <hi>Tyre?</hi> It must be own'd that he did not alwaies make use of a fair deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Council, whose Acts were bottom'd on true Church prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: He, indeed, waved every one, which he suspected to be such, as much as he could.

                     </note> and their power; and it was un-Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically done, (for the <hi>Eusebian</hi> Bishops were at first the lesser part of the Council) but the Bishops alone, made the Decree, and pass'd the Judiciary Sentence upon him; notwithstanding that <hi>Constantius</hi> was there in his Person. And which is more; the same Synod which remov'd <hi>Athanasius</hi> made <hi>Gregorius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in his room: And we hence gain our other point, <hi>viz.</hi> That as the Rights of the Empire were not conceiv'd to enable the Emperor for the removal of a Bishop, once fixed in his See by the proper and righful hands; so they were not conceiv'd to be competent for the enthroning and justly posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a Bishop in a See, tho' Synodically made void. And as <hi>Constantius</hi> did not <hi>dare</hi> to do the <hi>one;</hi> (for why may I not use the expression concerning him, since St. <hi>Austin</hi> us'd it of his Father in the same case) so nor the <hi>other,</hi> in his own right, as Emperor.</p>
                  <p>I shall not here undertake to determine how far the deposing a Bishop by an Heretical Synod does oblige; or by an Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox one, if it proceed upon false suggestions, publickly known to be such, and to be malitiously prosecuted: neither doth our present enquiry expect it of me. It suffices us at present that <hi>Constantius</hi> did once think fit to make use of Bishops, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing <hi>Athanasius;</hi> and did it not then by his own secular Arm: Hence I thus argue. That we cannot, upon common thoughts, apprehend, since as <hi>Constantine</hi> his Father had done before him in the Council of <hi>Tyre;</hi> so <hi>Constantius</hi> the son would not have proceeded against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and remov'd him in this Council by the Bishops, if he could have effectually done it by his own Power and Authority, separate from 'em, and independent upon them; if he had not been assur'd, as his Father was, that his secular, worldly Arm was incompetent for it; or if he could have satisfied himself, that he had had but a coordinate power with them in order to it. The Argument is much stronger on <hi>Constantius</hi>'s side, since his displeasure towards <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> was much greater than <hi>Constontine</hi>'s: It was to excess, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his insuperable adherence to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came so publick that the Heathen Historian<note n="†" place="margin">Ammian. Marcell. l. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note> takes notice of it, and reports it to the world in these words: <hi>Athanasio semper infensus.</hi> Is it any ways credible that he should seek, nay catch
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:200314:60"/> at the advantage of a Synod, as he did of this; put the issue of so desir'd a cause, and the conquest of so considerable a Person, to its hazard; nay use tricks in it, which he would have been asham'd of at another time; and employ his Courtiers to bring the Bishops, by threats and violence, to his side, when himself, (as some would have it) was at the same time, the supream Judge of the cause, and could singly, and alone, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and irreversibly have determin'd and decided it? His parasite Courtiers upon whose provocation he so much the more desir'd it, could not be ignorant of such a right, if he could have pretended to it. And they would have so order'd it, that no hands but his own should have executed it: But by no means can it be conceiv'd that the Emperor wou'd have been beholden to the Bishops for the doing of it: Especially since the charge of High treason lay against <hi>Athanasius:</hi> In which case Doctor <hi>Hody</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 10.</note> tells us, <hi>That if</hi> Cornelius <hi>had been depos'd by</hi> Decius, <hi>we have all the reason in the world to believe, that his deprivation would have been lookt upon by St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>as very reasonable and just,</hi> and that that great Archbishop would have submitted to it: Though neither <hi>Constantius</hi> nor <hi>Constantine</hi> were aware that they had any such power: Nor would <hi>Athanasius</hi> have submitted to it, if they executed it upon him. And surely, the Sun is not clearer at high noon, then that these two Emperors supremacies were not conceiv'd to instruct and enable them for it: Or, which is more, that the then Christian World did not believe it self oblig'd to comply with them, if they had usurped it.</p>

                     </gap> to make it very plain, that the Catholicks, at this time of day, (for surely we may conclude them to have been all of the same mind with these above named) did not place this custome and <hi>Law of the Church,</hi> by which the fixing a Bishop in his See, and the continuing him there, or removing him, and making way, upon his removal, for a <hi>Successor,</hi> is subjected in Church hands, and that the Prince is not permitted to perform it without them: Nothing, I say, seems more plain, then that these Christians did not place these actions, I say they did not place them amongst some other indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in her polity, which were not so <hi>sacred</hi> and <hi>indefeisable,</hi> but that <hi>she readily</hi> superceded, nay <hi>Sacrificed,</hi> them, <hi>whensoever necessity requir'd it, to the peace and tranquility of the Church:</hi> But on the contrary, that their observation was immutably retain'd by them, tho' the worst of consequences did attend it, from any, either <hi>Soveraign, Coercive Power, or irresiscible Party;</hi> the evils being greater, by a relaxation, and complyance, then any future good that can possibly accrue unto the Church of God. Surely the exercise of that power, the violation of which is a <hi>breach of the Ordinance of Christ, the work of Antichrist, unjust and ungodly, unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidented</hi> by its novelty, <hi>and not to be receiv'd into a Christians thoughts,</hi> (for as such they characterize it, and worse, in the foremention'd citations) is not an indifferent thing; nor can they, who have so stigmatized it, be conceiv'd to have thought it a matter of so little moment, as Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> does: Surely these first Christians did not think the <hi>outward peace and tranquillity</hi> of the Church to be an equivalent for the damage she would receive, by such a secular
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:200314:64"/> Ministration, if vouch'd, and submitted to, by them. What per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions did they not suffer, and patiently undergo, in the loss of their Estates and Liberties, nay in their capacities of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating to their people in holy things, rather than yeild in this point? And though we cannot prove, that any one <hi>Bishop in the three first Centuries was disown'd by the Church, because he was put into the place of another deposed by the civil authority,</hi> (as the Doctor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonably demands of us) because no one Emperor, within that space of time did act such a work of <hi>Antichrist:</hi> Yet since the Doctor has extended his <hi>Epoche,</hi> in another<note n="*" place="margin">To the Reader.</note> place, <hi>to this day:</hi> We can prove to the contrary, and that it has been done over and over again by more than one Bishop, since these following most eminent Bishops in the fourth <hi>Century, viz.

                  <p>I Am very well assured that Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> will here reply, as he does upon several other occasions and say; that though the deprivation of the foremention'd Bishops was <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>uncanonical,</hi> yet that was not the reason, why those Bishops refus'd to acknowledg and submit unto it, and to the <hi>Successors</hi> which were placed over them: But because those <hi>Successors</hi> were <hi>Arians:</hi> If they had been Orthodox, they would have acquiesced and communicated with them.

                     <hi>Theodorit</hi> says in express words, that the Synod of <hi>Millane</hi> was conveen'd on purpose to give credit and Authority to <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s deposition, in the Synod of <hi>Tyre.</hi> And the other two Historians say the same in effect: But when <hi>Constantius</hi> found that he was not able to carry it, the <hi>Western</hi> Bishops running as one man against it, he remov'd the Synod into his Palace, resolving to carry it by his own Authority and Power: And in the virtue of it, he there depos'd <hi>Athanasius</hi> with <hi>a non obstante;</hi> although the Law, the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:200314:65"/> Canons, Justice, and all the <hi>Western</hi> Bishops, were against it, and disallow'd it: And this is the usurped right and power, which the true Church of God, there, and then, opposed, and protested against: not fearing the wrath of the King, nor the persecutions, which fell upon them, by reason of it.</p>

And professed and maintain'd the coessential and coeternal Nature of the Father and the Son, in the full sense and importance, of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith: They only omitted the word <gap reason="foreign">

And they thought (at least pretended, that, since the thing and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery were receiv'd, the expression and explication might make disputes, but would add nothing, in reality to it. And what ever else <hi>Constantine, Constantius,</hi> and their <hi>Eusebius,</hi> contriv'd and practised against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> was in order to his Deposition, and final removing, from his Ministery, and Church, at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> which thing they endeavour'd to effect, not by articling against him as an <hi>Homo♉sian;</hi> they did not once attempt it; but by arraigning him as one, <hi>That imposed tribute on she Emperor's Subjects; that was a traytor and rebel to</hi> Constantius, <hi>in that he supply'd one</hi> Philumenus <hi>with mony, who was his enemy; that he made

Of which our Histories have given an account at large. And as they proceeded upon one, or more of these, when they actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd him, and put <hi>Gregorius</hi> in his Chair; so, when he refus'd to submit to their Sentence, and own the <hi>Successor,</hi> which they put upon him, and the Catholick Bishops, his Brethren, united with him in it; it was because they lookt upon his removal to be unjust and uncanonical; whether as executed by their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in their Synod, or as executed by the Emperor, apar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And it was upon this account, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> suffer'd exile under <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine;</hi> and he with the other Bishops, afterwards underwent those heavy persecutions under <hi>Comstantius,</hi> not inferior to the <hi>Decian</hi> and <hi>Diocletian</hi> cruelties; only, they were not capital: These holy Prelates believing themselves oblig'd to <hi>resist</hi> even <hi>unto Blood,</hi> in defence and maintenance of the rightful Succession, according to the rules of the Church, as in defence and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith: And that they might no more dispense with a <hi>Successor</hi> upon other terms, then those which the Church allows, then with a false article in their Creed: And, also, that neither a Synod, nor the Empire, though Christian, could legitimate the one, more then the other: And that every <hi>Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> which is <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>uncanonical,</hi> is likewise incompetent, and does not oblige the <hi>Colledge</hi> of Bishops to own or submit to it: (though Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> is of another mind) they, herein, treading in the steps of the Ancient Church before <hi>Constantine,</hi> of which I may hereafter give an account.</p>
                  <p>And now, if this be made appear, and prov'd; as I am well assur'd it may, by notorious and undeniable matter of fact in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story: (the first part of it, relating to the <hi>Arianisme</hi> of that time, was started, and asserted, by a late and learned Bishop<note n="*" place="margin">Bishop <hi>Parke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For, though <hi>Eusebius</hi> was a good man, and subscrib'd conscientiously to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith, and its particular explication, in obedience to the Church of God; yet, as we must allow that he was so much an <hi>Arian,</hi> as to think, that the word <hi>Consubstantial</hi> had been better left out: And to have desir'd the Church's compliance, and to represent

                  <p>I am very apt to think, that <hi>Eusebius Pamphilus</hi> might refuse the Bishoprick of <hi>Antioch</hi> upon the account of the Schism; when, upon <hi>Eustathius</hi>'s Deposition, it was offer'd him by the Bishops and <hi>Constantine:</hi> And perhaps, the manner of <hi>Eustathius</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval was worse than it is represented, in our Historians short account of it; and the secular Force contributed too much to it, as it did to <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s removal, in the Council of <hi>Tyre;</hi> and this might, in part, keep <hi>Eusebius</hi> out of it; for he was, certainly, a good man, as to the main: But the most likely reason of his refusing it was, because his receiving it, would not have compor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Church principle of <hi>one Bishop in one See;</hi> nor with the Ancients Judgment, upon <hi>Novatianus</hi>'s assuming <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Chair, and violating that principle; of which we have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from himself in his <hi>Church History.</hi> Besides; the<note n="‖" place="margin">Soz. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>18.</hi> Euseb. de vita Constantini lib. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>58, 59.</hi>

The word <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-Arian</hi> is often used by Ecclesiastical men: (and is often wrong applied by them) but it is never used (if I do not mistake) within this interval of time, concerning which we are now making an inquiry, tho the thing it self is obvious there. But the word, <hi>Arian,</hi> is there all along promiscuously used, and applyed to all those that did not come up to the top of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, tho it is as manifest as the Sun is, in a clear day at noon, that all of them did not deny the Eternal Nature of the Son of God, and the <hi>Homoousian</hi> explication of it. And if he, who shall peruse the History of <hi>Arianisme</hi> contain'd within our <hi>Epoche,</hi> does omit to observe this various use of the word, it will involve him in a great, and even, inextricable confusion: But he, especially, that reads this Discourse, must needs be at a loss; for we here assert <hi>Arianisme</hi> to have ceased, since the Council of <hi>Nicea,</hi> and yet there is nothing so frequent here as the terms. <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anisme</hi>

Possibly <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s prudence may be question'd in making the offer, but no other sense can be put upon it, which is consistent with his own, and the other Catholick Bishops practice, concerning <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s, and their remonstrance upon <hi>Constantius,</hi> when he comply'd with his Deposition, confirming it with his secular Sentence: Of which I have give an account. Did not these Catholick Bishops rather suffer exile than subscribe to his Condemnation? That duty which is not absolutly necessary, but may be commuted, will not warrant Martyrdom in its defence: And tho' I am to forego my liberty and life, rather than quit an Article of Faith; I may not defend it by quitting another duty which my Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity alike obliges me to. Neither may any other sense, of this offer, which <hi>Eusebius</hi> made, be consistent with <hi>Constantius</hi>'s far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceedings against the <hi>Homo♉sians:</hi> In which the stress of their trial is put upon their consenting to <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.

                     <hi>Athanasius</hi> gives of the proceedings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Hosius,</hi> is; that when <hi>Constantius</hi> first sent for him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and interrogated him, it was solely in reference to his adhereing to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and to engage him to subscribe to his Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to communicate with the <hi>Arians:</hi> That the holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop replied to him with such weight of argument; and gave such effectual reasons, why he ought not to do it, that the Emperor was convinced, and dismiss'd him, with leave to return to his Country and Church: but this brought no small trouble to the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> especially the Eunuchs and Courtiers: which last, according to their usual practice, provok'd and embitter'd <hi>Constantius,</hi> to a greater excess, against him: Insomuch that he wrote a menacing Letter to him, to the former effect: with the contumelies and reproaches of which, <hi>Athanasius</hi> tells us, the most religious Prelate was affected, but its terrors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd nothing with him for the changing his opinion, <hi>which he had found upon the firm Rock of Faith;</hi> but he retain'd it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, with his first constancy: When the Emperor wrote a second Letter to him, mixing some flatteries with his threats, but to the same end; requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:200314:78"/> or his Ministers, might not come into a Council, but that they may not, when they are there, assume and exercise the Rights and Powers which belong to the Bishops and Clergy: For we well know, that the first Council at <hi>Nicea</hi> was, not only call'd by <hi>Constantine</hi>'s writ, but conveen'd in his Palace, (as the second General Council at <hi>Constantinople</hi> afterwards did in <hi>Trullo: i. e.</hi> in a certain arch'd room in <hi>Theodosius</hi>'s Palace) and the Emperor<note n="*" place="margin">Euseb. de vit.

                  <p>This is all that <hi>Constantius</hi> could obtain from these two great Men, either by himself or his Emissaries, in these two famous Congresses: Only he thought fit to try <hi>Liberius</hi> two ways more, <hi>viz.</hi> by bribes or banishment: But he desir'd that the bribes might be given to the Emperor's two Bishops, <hi>viz. Auxentius</hi> and <hi>Epictetus,</hi> as persons whom they would gratify, for himself scorn'd them. And he chearfully submitted to the banishment, as that which was his portion, and a Christian Bishop ought <hi>not to think strange</hi> of.</p>

Again, must not <hi>Athanasius, Hosius,</hi> &amp;c. be very unthinking men, when they plead the Laws and Canons of the Church in their own defence, as most sacred, and inviolable, as the indispensable Rules in their Case, and when they suffer'd in the Observation of them, and when they requir'd a lawful Synod to determine, apart from the Prince and his Substitutes, and that the Church Power, but <hi>neither of them,</hi> should exercise Jurisdiction in it?

                  <p>But this first Creed, and the <hi>Anathemaes</hi> against <hi>Photinus</hi> which they annex'd to it, were made purely to serve a turn, their Politicks instructing them to manage their disguise a while longer: that expression which we may find in one of their <hi>Anathemaes,</hi> where the <hi>Son</hi> is said to administer to the <hi>Father</hi> in the Work of the Creation, does a little unveil them, and create a suspition of their design, tho' the Ancients have made use of it very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently. They did not miss of the craft of most Hereticks, in that they denounc'd these <hi>Anathemas</hi> before they declar'd themselves, it being their usual artifice to oppose some one, or more Heresies with great shew of vehemency, and thereby introduce their own with more ease and advantage, and so they seldom miss of their aim, for the many being possess'd of their Orthodoxy, as they apprehend, in some points, they can hardly be induc'd to believe that they can be erroneous in any other, but credulously receive all that they offer to them.

Again, a Bishop that is not an <hi>Arian,</hi> nor otherways Heretical, but renounces the Catholick Communion, and separates from the Episcopal Colledge, may not, either be communicated with, and this was the case of <hi>Liberius,</hi> upon his subscription against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and of <hi>Felix,</hi> upon his assuming <hi>Liberius</hi>'s Chair, when he had been exil'd by <hi>Constantius:</hi> but I shall have a farther opportunity to consider <hi>Liberius</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> anon: I have here but toucht upon them (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Hosius</hi>) that I might take occasion (for the omission of which I could not pardon my self) to expose that crude im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Plea which Dr. <hi>Hody</hi> frequently makes, in vindication of his most false assertion, [viz. <hi>That unjust possession legitimates a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, if he be not an Heretick</hi>] as from the Practise of the Church of God, when he tells us; <hi>that such and such Bishops, when they were plac'd in Sees by the secular arm, upon unlawful Deprivations, were ejected, but it was because they were Arians,</hi> and that <hi>their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just possession was not a competent ground for their ejection,</hi> since it is so very plain, not only upon Church Practise, but upon Church Principles, that, as they were <hi>Arians,</hi> so if they were also Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Possessors, as their <hi>Arianism,</hi> so their Schism upon such possession, did disable them, and put a just bar to the Peoples receiving,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:200314:82"/> and communicating with them: And the <hi>Doctor</hi> ought to have prov'd, but has not attempted it, <hi>that their Arianism, or other Heresie, could alone do it, but their Schism could not.</hi> And yet he insults all along upon the Plea as unanswerable, and makes it over and over, even to nauseousness.</p>
                  <p>A little after the Composure of the Second Creed at <hi>Sirmium</hi> the <hi>Oriental</hi> Bishops met, first at <hi>Ancyra,</hi> and then at <hi>Sirmium,</hi> and there corrected its Heresies and Blasphemies: and tho' <hi>Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>

                  <p>Nor do I believe that any one, who thinks at all, can be so loose in his thoughts as not to apprehend, that the same Power, which has an indefiesable right to remove the Magistrates of a Corporation upon its own terms, and place Successors in their room, and oblige the Society to receive them, may not, and will not, by often changing, and the advantage of man's corrupt heart, overthrow the Laws, and alter the Constitutions of that Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, when ever it shall think fit. <hi>Constantius</hi> and his <hi>Eusebians</hi> practice are a sad, but true instance of it, who by these means incorporated <hi>Exoukontianism</hi> into the Church: A full improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Doctor <hi>Hody</hi>'s, and his <hi>Greek</hi>'s principle would have kept it there for ever, if the Empire had so pleas'd. But as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remnant</hi> thought it their duty to oppose them for that one reason, and to adhere their proper Bishops, so they preserv'd the true Faith in opposition to them: And all good Christians and Bishops ought to do the same.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but be sorry, that our <hi>British</hi> Island hath lately given us two instances; the one of which comes short of these Orthodox Bishops practice, and the other exemplifies the Hereticks practice and its sad event, but, I hope, without their destructive inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. We have had a Synod, in which our Divines acted learnedly and zealously in the behalf of the outward Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Church, but without their Metropolitan, and others of our Bishops, whom the secular Arm alone withheld from them, and, which is worse, without desiring them, or enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the reason of their absence: Herein they came short of the Orthodox Clergy in the case of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and others, particularly in the Synods of <hi>Sardica</hi> and <hi>Millane.</hi> We have had also our <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and more of the Colledge, depriv'd (Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> says <hi>unjustly</hi> and <hi>uncanonically</hi>) by the secular Arm; and

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:200314:89"/> and therefore made new ones, upon their declaring themselves to be <hi>Arians,</hi> which was done after the aforesaid <hi>Epoche:</hi> Is it not very odd and inconsistent to think and say, that they were then <hi>Arians,</hi> and that their right was not own'd; nor their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testative judicial acts of Government receiv'd as competent, and valid, meerly because of Heresie? Can a more favourable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure be pass'd upon those that maintain this, than that they were ignorant of the state of persons and things within that time? Or can the Catholicks, who are suppos'd to have refus'd them, be accounted so unthinking and imprudent as to do it upon that account, since their adversaries might so very easily clear themselves of the aspersion, and invalidate their reason, from their own concessions? For, what was more ready for their reply, then this, <hi>viz.</hi> That their own mouths had acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them of it? Might not these <hi>Eusebians</hi> have loaded them back with the guilt of Schism, and Disobedience, upon their non-submission to their <hi>Successors,</hi> if their present <hi>Arianism</hi> had been the only thing they had to plead in their own defence? If therefore the <hi>Eusebians unjust</hi> and <hi>uncanonical Deprivations</hi> and <hi>Possessions</hi> did not put the bar, <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his Party will hardly be found justifiable in not submitting to them, since it did not appear, but that <hi>in all other respects they were such whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion no good Catholick could refuse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we admit the <hi>Eusebians</hi> to have been profess'd <hi>Arians,</hi> within our <hi>Epoche,</hi> or distance of time, how does it follow, that the <hi>Abdications</hi> and <hi>Successions,</hi> which they then created, were rejected by the <hi>Athanasians</hi> as incompetent and invalid, for that reason only? Might there not have been social Reasons that equally oblig'd them to it? It is evident that there were others, and that they were reputed competent, because the <hi>unjustness</hi> and <hi>uncanonicalness</hi> of the <hi>Abdications</hi> and <hi>Successions,</hi> were mostly, if not only, pleaded, as the reasons why they were not receiv'd: I do not remember that the <hi>Successor</hi>'s <hi>Arianism</hi> is once directly insisted on, as its reason: but the undue <hi>Abdication</hi> is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently: and the Catholicks refusing to receive the <hi>Successor</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of the latter, is that which occasions their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries objection against them. Besides, may not he that is an <hi>Arian</hi> be a Schismatick too?

Bishops were professedly <hi>Arians,</hi> in the days of <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperor, and unjustly possess'd of most of the Sees of <hi>Christendom,</hi> but the Catholicks were not less careful and conscientious to keep up the rightful Succession, than the rightful Doctrine, in opposition to them, and the malignity of the Schism oblig'd them to it, as much as the malignity of the Heresie; otherwise the Church was mistaken before, when she rejected the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatists.</hi> But I have already<note n="†" place="margin">

And yet I cannot forbear to add this following recantation, which <hi>Arsenius</hi> made, (who is stil'd <hi>Episcopus Hyspelitarum,</hi> and was the man, whose hand the <hi>Eusebians</hi> pretended to have been cut off by <hi>Athanasius,</hi> they bringing him into the open Court to evidence it) upon discovery of the Plot, which those Children of darkness had laid deep for the destruction of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and his repentance and reception into the Church: The Recantation ought to be laid up in the Churches <hi>Archives,</hi> as a president in the same, or like case: but I here recite it, as an undeniable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, That it was one part, at least, of Bishop <hi>Arsenius</hi>'s guilt, in that he not only concurr'd with the <hi>Eusebians</hi> most impious device, for the taking away <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s life, but in that he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise joyn'd with them in their most abominable Schism, by breaking the lawful Succession, in turning <hi>Athanasius</hi> wrongfully out of his See, and bringing in a false Bishop, as a <hi>Second,</hi> into his Chair. This is the Sin which he here condoles and recants for by name, and principally, if not solely, repent; him of, promising to have no more communion with them in their Schism, but to return to his lawful Metropolitan, as the Laws of the Church require: here is not one word of his joyning with them in the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie, nor any thing like a retractation on that account: they did not indeed then profess it, but it's contrary: neither may we think the Church would have receiv'd <hi>Arsenius</hi> without his retracting it, if he had concurr'd with the <hi>Eusebians</hi> in an open profession of it.

It farther appears, as clear as the Sun at noon-day, That the rejecting a Bishop lawfully possess'd of his Chair, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving an uncanonical Successor upon him, was not accounted an <hi>indifferent thing</hi> in <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s time; and that the Church had other Rules in those cases, besides its present outward advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, tho' a Sovereign Coercive Power had <hi>Abdicated</hi> the Right, and <hi>possess'd</hi> the wrong; since the <hi>Athanasians</hi> did not submit to <hi>Constantius</hi> under such emergencies, but believ'd themselves obliged by the Law of God, to maintain the lawful and canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Successions, and refuse the contrary; as to maintain the true Faith, and refuse that which is Heretical. Even the <hi>Eusebians</hi> would not receive <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and some other Bishops, tho' the <hi>Sardican</hi> Synod, with the assent of <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Constans,</hi> and what authority they could give to that action, had re-establisht them in their Sees, because they suppos'd their own precedeing Church-Censures, by which they had been depos'd, were just and canonical, and a supervening authority incompetent to rescind them, tho' it were the Empires own: and not only so, but they call'd a Synod in the <hi>East,</hi> and confirm'd those Censures, nay excommunicated <hi>Julius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> because he had a hand in reversing them. Did not the <hi>Athanasians</hi> undergo more than one persecution, rather then own a false <hi>Succession,</hi> and submit to <hi>Constantius</hi>'s imperial Power, which erected it? Was this to consult the <hi>outward peace</hi> and <hi>tranquility</hi> of the Church, before her just Rights and Enfranchisments?

                     <hi>That</hi> Felix <hi>the second Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>who was Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, was in the year</hi> ccclv. <hi>put into the place of</hi> Liberius, <hi>an Orthodox
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:200314:92"/> Bishop of that City, he being depos'd by the Emperor</hi> Constantius; <hi>and that</hi> Liberius <hi>was depos'd and banish'd by the bare Authority of the Emperor, without any pretence to a Synod, and that too very unjustly; for no other reason, but because he was Orthodox, and refus'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with him in subscribing to the condemnation of</hi> Athanasius <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>is manifest beyond all doubt, from the testimonies of all Historians: And tho he was made Bishop in the room of the unjustly depriv'd</hi> Liberius; <hi>yet, first, the Catholick Bishops of his own District communicated with him, and receiv'd him as their Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan. Secondly, his Ordinations were receiv'd, and allow'd of as valid, by, even, his Adversary</hi> Liberius. <hi>Thirdly, the whole</hi> We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern <hi>Church has all along own'd him as one of the true Bishops of</hi> Rome.</p>
                  <p>And I not wonder if this stroke does seem, in the eyes of some, to fall heavy upon us, especially in the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, (and some others of his complexion) who hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly shew'd to the World, that he seldom sees half way, and that it is the surface of an argument, which generally over-rules him: But it can appear no more than a flea-biting to those, that have their eyes in their head.

This (I say) can no ways vouch their most false and pernicious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which they have endeavour'd to obtrude upon mankind, <hi>viz. That an unlawful Possessor, upon a lay and unjust Deprivation, if he be Orthodox, may be warrantably receiv'd, and submitted to, he ought to be, by the ejected Bishop, tho' he is every ways Orthodox, and depriv'd for adhering to the truth, and opposing Vice or Heresie.</hi> For all Histories are <hi>silent,</hi> and give us no account that <hi>Liberius</hi> receiv'd and submitted to <hi>Felix,</hi> as Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or did any thing that can create a Suspition of it.

It would be a detraction from their integrity to say, that these Lay-Believers had no Bishopricks, nor Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualities, to lose, as the Clergy had: And that is the reason why they did not comply, as the Clergy did, but kept to their duties of spiritual Allegiance; when their Captains so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deserted, nay acted contrary to it. But I heartily wish that there were less pregnant reasons producible, and obliging me to think, that the Clergy had never complyed with <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> nor enthroned <hi>Felix,</hi> if they had not well known that he otherwise, would take their temporalities from them.</p>

But this Election was carried not with design to invade the Laws of the Church so as to plead the Right of the Empire against the Church in it, and Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> and his friends will have no advantage by it. <hi>Damasus</hi> was no less unfortunate in the managment of his righful title against <hi>Ursicinus,</hi> it being done, not only in a tumultuous way, but in spilling of blood, of which we have account in our other Historians<note n="*" place="margin">Socrat. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>24.</hi> Soz. l. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>22</hi>

                  <p>Once more; it is also hence evident, that, as professed Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and <hi>Arianism</hi> in particular, was then reputed one just ground for the refusal of a Bishop, and not holding communion with him, if Heresie be made the Terms of it, so profess'd Schism was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted another, and it was not then judged lawful to hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with a false Succession of Bishops, or with those that Schismatically communicated with them.

And why may they not as well have communicated with <hi>Felix?</hi> Or how could they be less pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in it? It being a certain Rule in the Church, that if a Bishop breaks the righful Succession, by invading a full See, as <hi>Majorinus</hi> did, when he came into <hi>Cecilianus</hi>'s Chair at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and if one legally possessed of a See, and, so far, no violator of Church-Unity, shall, notwithstanding, give to the Usurper his Letters of Peace, and communicate with him, as <hi>Marcian,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Epistles, did to the <hi>Novatian</hi> Bishops, who had usurped upon <hi>Carthage,</hi> and broke the Church's Succession, in the same manner <hi>Majorinus,</hi> and the <hi>Donatists,</hi> did afterwards, and if a People communicate with such, they therein joyn with them in their Schism, and the Bishops, and Believers, contract its guilt upon their Souls, and the Church hath still markt them for Schismaticks, and shun'd them.</p>

                     <hi>Baronius</hi>'s authority on his side, (even the two Presbyters in their <hi>Preface,</hi> overthrow the substantial part of it) so <hi>Baronius</hi> produceth only some <hi>Apochryphal</hi> lives of their Popes for it, in which there will not be any such thing found neither, without the help of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi>'s conjecture, which usually, takes a great Liberty.</p>
                  <p>Besides, how were the Catholicks less Schismaticks in deserting <hi>Liberius,</hi> upon his subscribing, and communicating with the <hi>Arians,</hi> (if he did so,) then in receiving <hi>Felix,</hi> and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with him (which the Cardinal and the Doctor suppose) who is own'd, by all, to have communicated with the <hi>Arians,</hi> since both were Orthodox? Though the Doctor takes a strange liberty, and says that <hi>Liberius</hi> was an <hi>Arian,</hi> and therein differs from the Cardinal. But, I shall shew his precariousness in it anon.</p>
                  <p>But to leave the Cardinal and the Doctor in the enjoyment of their own imaginations, and speak briefly, but home, to the matter: our Histories are short here, as they are in many other cases, and do not give us any account of <hi>Liberius</hi> and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers at <hi>Rome,</hi> from the time that they petition'd <hi>Constantius</hi> for his return, untill he actually repossessed his Chair, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised his Function among them, save that they rejected <hi>Felix,</hi> in that interval, so we are altogether ignorant of the manner and degrees of <hi>Liberius</hi>'s repentance, upon his subscription against <hi>Athanasius</hi> and coming into the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> as also of the manner, and time in which the People receiv'd and recognized him. Yet we are not to doubt but that it was done upon his satisfaction, (not in order to his second enthronization, upon the death of <hi>Felix,</hi> whom they fancy to have died the lawful and Catholick Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>) whereby he was restor'd to the Church's Unity, from which his lapse broke him off, and the Believers Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him was legitimated. Some high <hi>Romanist</hi> Zealots, who receive the Council of <hi>Sinuessa,</hi> will possibly tell us, from the example of Pope<note n="*" place="margin">

We may not believe, that since the Church Rules and practice from the beginning, do not permit a lapsed Bishop to be received, but upon satisfaction, these Believers at <hi>Rome</hi> on the one hand, or this eminent and most exemplary Bishop, (all along save in this one matter of subscription) on the other hand, would have reunited as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor and People, and not in a thorow compliance to those Rules and Practice.

For nothing can give a greater blow to a Sect then its remissness in that nature, especially when the succession of Pastors is not continued.

                     <hi>Hilary</hi> have done it.

                     <hi>Athanasius</hi> says expresly, (what ever it was that <hi>Liberius</hi> subscrib'd unto) he subscrib'd through force, and retain'd his first sentiments entire: and we have just now prov'd that he entred upon his government immediatly upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and that the Catholicks receiv'd him, and communicated under him. And we may easily farther think, that he as soon declar'd the force, and asserted his Catholicism, and made sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for his Errors, upon Church grounds, without which he is not to be imagined to have been receiv'd. And since he stood upon the same foot of Orthodoxy, the Docter supposes <hi>Fel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:200314:101"/> to have done, and was replaced on his Throne by the Empire, and <hi>Felix</hi> rejected, if the Clergy, upon the Doctor's principles, believ'd themselves in Conscience bound to submit to the <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor,</hi> being Orthodox; they cannot be suppos'd to have chose the latter and rejected the former, but, on the contrary, to have receiv'd <hi>Liberius</hi> and quitted <hi>Felix;</hi> unless they openly violated the Prince's Right and their own Consciences.</p>
                  <p>Tho', after all there is not one word of this affects our present case; for, if <hi>Liberius</hi> did, at last, become an Heretick, and was rejected by the Catholicks upon it, the Doctor has own'd that he was Orthodox at the time of his Deprivation, and two years after. And since the same Catholicks, whom he supposes to have rejected <hi>Liberius</hi> for his Heresie, and not to have receiv'd him until he had retracted it, did adhere to him whilst he was Orthodox, notwithstanding his <hi>Secular Deprivation,</hi> it thence directly follows, that <hi>Liberius</hi>'s Secular Deprivation was not a competent ground, in it self, for a people's Translation of their allegiance, during a Bishop's Orthodoxy. And their after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting <hi>Liberius,</hi> as an Heretick, if such a thing was done, will only so far justify the Doctor's design, and vindicate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Vacancy of our Sees by an unjust and uncanonical Deprivation,</hi> as they can prove our respective deprived Bishops to have been Heretical likewise: which none pretends, nor can ever do.</p>
                  <p>It will be objected, that <hi>Constantius</hi> would not have permitted <hi>Liberius</hi> to return and reassume his See, unless <hi>Liberius</hi> had, not only subscrib'd to <hi>Arianism,</hi> but, continued a Professor, and Propugner of it, according to his power, since he was exil'd, and depriv'd, partly, because he refused to do it, and <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> otherwise, would have been defeated of his design, which he never sincerely quitted, but continu'd in truth a rigid <hi>Exoukontian,</hi> and irreconciliable opposer of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Article. But our Histories, as I have already observ'd, speak very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly of this affair, if they be not altogether silent. And since all the account they give of <hi>Liberius</hi> after his return, is, that he was a<note n="*" place="margin">Se Socrat. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>11.</hi> Soz. l. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>10, 11.</hi>
                     </note> zealous <hi>Anti Aetian,</hi> and also <hi>Anti-Eusebian Arian,</hi> until his death. We are to look upon <hi>Constantius</hi>'s indulgence to him as the work of God, who can turn the hearts of Kings at his pleasure, in that the lawful Succession was restor'd, and Truth and Unity, in some measure, together with it, in the midst of that naughty Generation, through the Faith and Courage of the Believers; whose constancy to their duty to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:200314:101"/> their lawful Bishop, was a secundary means, by which it was effected, and they remain a beauteous example to posterity in the like case. And we may hence strengthen our expectations of the same mercy, that tho' our Pastors be hid from our eyes for a time, they shall be restor'd as at the beginning, if we, through want of Faith, and our just endeavours, do not desert them, and God, in his wrath, does not put a final bar to their return. Surely a truer sense of duty to an exil'd Bishop has not appear'd, then in these <hi>Roman</hi> Christians, for their Bishop <hi>Liberius,</hi> according to the account which all Historians give of it: Tho' Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> is so unfortunate as to make them one of his <hi>Proofes, or Presidents,</hi> for the warranting our practice, in receiving every <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>uncanonical Deprivation,</hi> and <hi>Successor,</hi> if he be <hi>Orthodox.</hi> I will add,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Doctor keeps true to his wide arguings, when he would have us believe it to be imply'd, that <hi>because the Clergy of</hi> Rome <hi>had a regard to Orthodoxy and the Faith, in their Oath which they took to be true to</hi> Liberius, <hi>upon his departure, and thereby engag'd themselves to accept no other Bishop as long as he should live, that was likely to destroy the Faith, they, therefore, did not engage themselves unto him by it, that they would not receive another upon his</hi> unjust <hi>and</hi> uncanonical Deprivation. For, surely, the Oath, and its engagement, might take in both considerations: And why it did not, especially, since <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s and other Deprivations that were unjust and uncanonical are known to have put a bar to their <hi>Successors:</hi> Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> may, possibly, be the man that is able to give an account. But thus he will argue all along; as because the Catholicks did refuse to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with particular Bishops that were <hi>Exoukontians,</hi> therefore these Bishops Lay and forcible Rights to their Sees were not also a just ground for those Catholicks to separate from them: the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy bound themselves by Oath that they would not receive an Heretick into <hi>Liberius</hi>'s See; and for that reason they did not oblige themselves, by the same Oath, that they would not receive an intruding Schismatick upon him: Besides, the Doctor<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 45. <hi>line</hi> 2.</note> tells us, that <hi>upon</hi> Liberius<hi>'s return, and the</hi> Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licians<hi>'s coming into him, he pardon'd them for breaking their Oath, (tho he would have it call'd by another name) and they pardon'd him for his Apostacy.</hi> And I thus argue upon him <hi>ex ore suo,</hi> that their Oath could not relate solely to the true Faith, and to nothing else, because then they would not have wanted a pardon, since
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:200314:102"/> their bringing in <hi>Felix</hi> upon him made no change in the Faith, nor any violation of their Oath, as to that. Neither can they be conceiv'd to have obliged themselves by this Oath, but only upon Church principles, as <hi>knowing that who soever was put upon him would be a true Bishop,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 44. <hi>line</hi> 5, 6.</note>
                     <hi>and the principles of those times did not oblige them to think otherwise.</hi> And it was their duty upon, <hi>Felix</hi>'s coming to the Chair, as a <hi>Successor,</hi> to receive him. So then, their breaking that first part of the Oath, which related to <hi>Liberius,</hi> was so far from wanting a pardon either, that it was their duty to break it, and to disclaim all manner of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to <hi>Liberius</hi> by it. It might be their fault in that they took such an Oath, but their breaking of it was their duty, which asks no pardon. A few just thoughts will direct an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced man thus to conclude, upon the whole matter: <hi>viz.</hi> That, since they broke an Oath, and sinn'd, and <hi>wanted pardon</hi> for it, it was, in that they brought <hi>Felix</hi> into the Chair at <hi>Rome,</hi> as a lawful Possessor, when it was quite contrary to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Church, which does not allow of such Possessors, and to their particular obligations, by that Oath, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And for this they wanted a pardon at <hi>Liberius</hi>'s hand, as he wanted a pardon for his Apostacy. Which breach of Oath is justly call'd their <hi>perjury</hi> by the two<note n="†" place="margin">Prefat. ad libel precum.</note>
                     <hi>Presbyters.</hi> Tho' the Doctor must be allow'd to be shy in calling it so, because the case comes too near some of his acquaintance.</p>

For these considerations, I say,</hi> Constantius <hi>immediately sent away a Messenger to</hi> Eusebius, <hi>with his Royal Commands, that he should deliver the Decree; to whom</hi> Eusebius <hi>replied, that he could not deliver up the common Decree, with which he had been publickly entrusted, without the common consent of those of his own Faith, who, as one man, had committed it to him. The Emperor being highly incensed against him for such his answer, sends the Messenger back unto him with authority to demand the Decree, and if he persisted in his refusal, to cut off his right-hand; but the most holy Bishop was so far from being fear'd and overaw'd to act against his conscience, that when the Messenger declar'd the Emperors pleasure, he reach'd forth, not only his right hand, but his left, and bad him cut of both, saying, I will not deliver the Decree which is so full a conviction of the</hi> Arian <hi>impiety, by reason of which greatness and constancy of mind, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, being informed of it, much admir'd and commended him.</hi> For
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:200314:106"/> enemies are wont to admire the eminent virtues of their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, being compell'd to it by their great action: As our Historian there well observes. And from the whole I shall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That a double, or <hi>second</hi> Election, and fixation in one and the same Chair, whilst the Person, first elected and fixed there, is alive, and not remov'd by his own consent, resignation, or some other due way, which the known Rules of the Church allow of; this proceeding (I say) was so very foul in those days, that the very <hi>Arians</hi> did shrink in upon it, and knew not how to submit into it: though<note n="*" place="margin">C. <hi>31.</hi> ibid. supra.</note>

And, if the want of a legal cancelling their first Votes, and Decree upon them, had not been a bar to their succeeding Election, nor laid it under the scandal of bringing a Bishop upon a full See, what was it could hinder <hi>Eusebius,</hi> but that he might have sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred his Paper? Or what needed the <hi>Arians</hi> to have been so urgent in demanding it? The one sure, is not to be conceiv'd, otherwise, to have expos'd himself to such mighty Sufferings, nor the other to have undergone, so much solicitude and trouble, as they did; and both he and they to have been so ill advis'd in the carriage of that affair. Much less may we think <hi>Constantius</hi> would have sent his Messenger twice, and such menaces along with him, concerning it, if there had not been a real purpose in it, and the effects had not been answerable: but thus it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been: and those evil men who do not boggle to tread on the necks of Laws, when to serve their own turn, will choose rather to keep them, and have the advantage of them, if it be consistent with their own project, and their design will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter managed by a compliance with them. It is hence also evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the quitting a right by cession, resignation, or the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:200314:106"/> legal cancelling it by what other just ways it may be done, is not so trifling and sapless a thing, as Doctor <hi>Hody</hi> has declar'd it to be for the securing a <hi>Possessor</hi> in his See, and rendring his <hi>Possession</hi> defensible to Mankind, though <hi>Constantius</hi> exil'd <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letius,</hi> and his <hi>Arians</hi> rejected him notwithstanding, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted <hi>Euzoius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> in his room.

The next thing that I am to take notice of, from this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical passage between <hi>Constantius, Eusebius,</hi> and the <hi>Arians,</hi> is, our great Bishop of <hi>Samosata</hi>'s just knowledge, zeal, and courage, in that he did not betray his trust, and give up the Church Rights, deposited in his hands, upon the demands, not only, of a Potent Faction, even <hi>irresistible,</hi> in Doctor <hi>Hody</hi>'s Sense, but of <hi>Constantius,</hi> and his <hi>Sovereign Coercive Power,</hi> requiring them of him, with his drawn Sword in his hand.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:200314:107"/> Presbyter and Deacon, that it is their own treachery alone, can betray and surrender them. The Arm of the most Potent cannot snatch and extort them from them, unless their Wills concur, and, in their Persons, they become assistants to him in it: And as it is their honour, so it ought to be their care, and earnest Prayers, that they be found faithful. Again, the same Wisdom of Christ our Saviour hath so order'd his Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and disposal of those Church Gifts, that if his Priests, with whom they are lodg'd, should make a general Apostacy, and surrender, or rather, acquit and devest themselves of them, nothing less then a new Feast of Penticost can restore and resettle them: The Edicts of Princes and Senates would be found insignificant in it; it would be their presumption, and their sin to attempt it. We are not then, to wonder that St. <hi>Paul</hi> so earnestly and solicitously advises <hi>Timothy</hi> in these words, <hi>O Timothe, depositum Custodi,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20.</note>

                     <hi>good thing</hi> which was <hi>committed to thee, keep by the Holy Ghost, which dwelleth in us.</hi> By which command we are not to doubt but that <hi>Eusebius</hi> was influenced: it reaching farther, in its design then to <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Person: neither may any one that duly consults the two Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, restrain that injunction to Doctrinals only. Surely, <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>'s care of the Church, and due behaviour in it, in respect of the ruling part, and succession of the Bishops, is thence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. It is most sure, that the trust which <hi>Samosatensis,</hi> so conscientiously preserved, was <hi>Meletius</hi>'s lawful right to the See at <hi>Antioch;</hi> in the keeping of which he was no less solicitous and conscientious, then he was to keep the <hi>Nicene</hi> Article of the the Eternal Generation. This is the Character which the two Emperors, <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> give of the <hi>Homoousian</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, in their Epistle to the <hi>Asian</hi> Diocess, in <hi>Theodorit</hi>'s<note n="‖" place="margin">L. 4. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> Church History. <hi>They do not</hi> (saith he) <hi>refuse to pay tribute according to the Laws; they do not oppose the Imperial Power, but holily and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely observe, as well our Laws, as the Commands of the great God and King.

                     </hi> did not comply with <hi>Constantius</hi> (notwithstanding the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd imperial Character of him) but withstood his commands and threats, and refused to deliver up the Credentials, and the Church Rights with them, though he had before obey'd his other Edicts, and deliver'd up the Temporalities of his Bishoprick into his hands, together with his Person, to be disposed of at his Royal Pleasure: of which I have already given<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</note> an account. And it is hence very plain, that the Civil and Spiritual Trust were two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct things, in the Sense of the then Empire: and the retaining the Spiritual, though against the Will of the Prince, was not reputed to be a breach of the former. Again, since <hi>Eusebius</hi> did not comply with <hi>Constantius</hi>'s Commands, and deliver the Church Credentials, it can be imputed only to his just sense of Duty to his God, which, even in our present instance of it, those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients believed themselves equally, nay antecedently, obliged to have a regard unto, as well as to their Duty to their Prince. The good Bishop justly apprehending, that his contributing, in the delivery of the Schedule, to the Settlement of <hi>Euzoius,</hi> in the full See of <hi>Antioch, Meletius</hi> being then alive, and not remov'd upon Church Terms, would be a Violation of the Law of God. Nothing else being supposable, upon the known Principles of that Age, and the Principles of the true Church in all Ages, to have with-held him from obedience to <hi>Constantius</hi>'s commands, requiring his surrender of the Papers, and the same considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons only could justifie him in it to the Christian World.</p>
                  <p>Thus God's great and infinite goodness to his Church has raised up men in all ages, who have asserted and maintain'd her Rights, upon every Emergency, even before Kings, who have sometimes endeavour'd to erase and sink them. But we have more eminent Examples of this Nature, over and above this of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Constantius,</hi> which was almost all over a Persecution: As, <hi>Athanasius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Eustathius</hi> and <hi>Meletius</hi> of <hi>Antioch, Paulus</hi> of <hi>Constantinople, Paulinus</hi> of <hi>France, Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Vercellis, Dyonisius</hi> of <hi>Italy, Lucifer,</hi> of <hi>Sardinia, Hilary</hi> of <hi>Poicteirs, Hosius</hi> of <hi>Corduba, Liberius</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which two last were highly serviceable after their lapses, upon their true repentance, as well as in their labours and sufferings, whilst they stood. <hi>Baronius</hi>
